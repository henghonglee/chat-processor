[29/11/24, 10:00:39 PM] Ben Menyala: ohh yeahh I didn’t quite get what data they need
[29/11/24, 10:00:52 PM] HengHongLee: they want to know the rates basically lol
[29/11/24, 10:01:05 PM] Ben Menyala: How to compare the net settle cost if we don’t have the hourly or daily fx rate
[29/11/24, 10:01:06 PM] HengHongLee: over time
[29/11/24, 10:01:21 PM] HengHongLee: we have the fx rate right
[29/11/24, 10:01:51 PM] Ben Menyala: The hourly one?
[29/11/24, 10:01:57 PM] Ben Menyala: We have the real time fx rate
[29/11/24, 10:02:04 PM] Ben Menyala: But don’t have the hourly or daily one
[29/11/24, 10:02:12 PM] HengHongLee: we have the rate difference, every 5min
[29/11/24, 10:02:45 PM] HengHongLee: we do have the 5min market rate also
[29/11/24, 10:03:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha yeahh
[29/11/24, 10:03:39 PM] HengHongLee: but once we give it, they will know 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[29/11/24, 10:03:39 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh so we find the average rate diff every 5 mins
[29/11/24, 10:03:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Vs taking the hourly one
[29/11/24, 10:03:53 PM] Ben Menyala: And see what’s the difference ahh
[29/11/24, 10:03:56 PM] HengHongLee: every single quote we know the rate vs the market rate
[29/11/24, 10:27:01 PM] Ben Menyala: I am thinking the data they’ll need is

Eg in a 6 hour period 10am - 4pm
Real time FX — assume $10 per every 5 minutes 
See 10-10.05am: our sgd-php rate * $10 
10:05-10:10: our rate * $10
….
3.55-4.00: our rate * $10

VS
Hourly settle:
11am: our sgd-php rate at 11am * $120
(12 txns in 1 hour period * $10)
12pm: 
….
4pm: our sgd-php rate at 4pm * $120 ‎<This message was edited>

[16/12/24, 7:16:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah. Unlike digital - like Wise and wallet businesses - they understand it
[16/12/24, 7:18:32 PM] Ben Menyala: 25 Ample customers want to send $1000 each to customers 

Ample sends $25,000 to StraitsX + $5000 dirty money 

StraitsX sends $30K to pdax 

Pdax sends $25K to recipients and $5k to shell account
[16/12/24, 7:18:47 PM] Ben Menyala: In this case is straitsX liable?
[16/12/24, 7:19:25 PM] Ben Menyala: For converting that 5K sgd dirty money into xsgd
[16/12/24, 7:19:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe could be stablecoin regulation
[16/12/24, 7:19:33 PM] Ben Menyala: Not sure
[16/12/24, 7:19:59 PM] Sandra Fortune: Straits X cannot send $30k. 
That’s the first that will get caught. Atomic movement.
[16/12/24, 7:20:24 PM] Ben Menyala: But we’re batching up now
[16/12/24, 7:20:37 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay imagine it’s 20K instead of $30k
[16/12/24, 7:20:38 PM] HengHongLee: the dirty 5k is still dirty 5k xsgd i think
[16/12/24, 7:20:50 PM] HengHongLee: either way not related to straitsx
[16/12/24, 7:20:52 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya I not sure if regulators will go after them
[16/12/24, 7:20:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: So it’s a violation of SX. As 5k is unaccounted for
[16/12/24, 7:21:37 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yes they will 
As txn amt (even in bulk) is different from originating source
[16/12/24, 7:22:17 PM] Sandra Fortune: But - because co-mingling is exist in the digital world - it applies to any flow that ample wants to digitise
[16/12/24, 7:23:12 PM] HengHongLee: i think its more related to travel rule compliance
[16/12/24, 7:23:23 PM] HengHongLee: that straitsx needs the kyc stuff
[16/12/24, 7:23:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh could be that too
[16/12/24, 7:24:06 PM] Sandra Fortune: So it’s their requirements to I collect part of KYC info
[16/12/24, 7:24:11 PM] Ben Menyala: But can’t travel rule be for businesses
[16/12/24, 7:24:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Hmm
[16/12/24, 7:24:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: Depends on the which country I think.
[16/12/24, 9:40:11 PM] Praise: Hmm. If it’s travel rule that that makes sense. But then I would still assume the business kyb should stand for it right
[16/12/24, 9:41:29 PM] Ben Menyala: yeahh business kyb should work
[16/12/24, 9:43:06 PM] Sandra Fortune: Agree on that. KYC travel rule can be fulfilled by getting partner to confirm that they could provide the specific KYC data they have received and verified - as long as they can demonstrate that - it will not be a compliance item ‎<This message was edited>
[16/12/24, 9:44:13 PM] Sandra Fortune: It’s more on co-mingle - which makes sense. In the digital world - the demarcation must be clear. 
In corp banking, we do a lot of VA opening for entities like Ali or Wise or even currency cloud
[16/12/24, 9:44:31 PM] Praise: If that’s the case we can remove the batch right? ‎<This message was edited>
[16/12/24, 9:44:37 PM] Praise: It’s not that prio
[16/12/24, 9:45:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: it refers more to a business putting client’s money into their operating account
[16/12/24, 9:45:56 PM] Sandra Fortune: Which in today’s practice - all traditional MTOs do that
[16/12/24, 9:46:32 PM] Sandra Fortune: It doesn’t exist in their world - I think. 
I’ve never heard of an MTO having VA or CMA (client money account)

[17/12/24, 9:05:52 AM] Ben Menyala: actually i think we really should chase HQ again haha

[17/12/24, 9:06:03 AM] Ben Menyala: https://www.hq.xyz/
[17/12/24, 9:06:25 AM] Ben Menyala: if triple A is charging alot for their crypto->bank rail
[17/12/24, 9:12:56 AM] Sandra Fortune: We should. But they seem to be busy with other fishes.
I think we should speak to that other guy to understand first on basics or go straight to Sharon and sunny 
Prefer to do the latter - but seems like they are swarmed
[17/12/24, 9:18:57 AM] Ben Menyala: haha yeahh gotta find another crypto event to ambush them
[17/12/24, 9:19:38 AM] Sandra Fortune: Probably we can reach out and schedule something in Jan . 😬
[17/12/24, 9:19:46 AM] Ben Menyala: hahah yehh

[17/12/24, 9:21:30 AM] Ben Menyala: but ya basically we can do this if we wanna let lulu import their wallet
[17/12/24, 9:22:37 AM] HengHongLee: lulu actually needs HQ more than they need us 😂
[17/12/24, 9:22:53 AM] Ben Menyala: yehh
[17/12/24, 9:22:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ya. Actually they do. Ke ke ke …
[17/12/24, 9:22:54 AM] Ben Menyala: hahahaha
[17/12/24, 9:23:01 AM] Ben Menyala: they can actually just use HQ
[17/12/24, 9:23:07 AM] HengHongLee: exactly
[17/12/24, 9:23:14 AM] HengHongLee: milind would love to hear that lol
[17/12/24, 9:23:18 AM] Ben Menyala: but they want to use another player cos of their rates
[17/12/24, 9:23:21 AM] Ben Menyala: I think HQ has strong PMF
[17/12/24, 9:23:30 AM] Ben Menyala: Great SaaS
[17/12/24, 9:23:32 AM] Ben Menyala: hahaha
[17/12/24, 9:23:37 AM] HengHongLee: haha sharon and sunny would be v happy to hear this
‎[17/12/24, 9:23:53 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[17/12/24, 9:24:20 AM] Sandra Fortune: They do. They just need to be more known amongst the web 2 people to get clients on board

[17/12/24, 9:26:40 AM] Ben Menyala: hahaha maybe we should also list here
[17/12/24, 9:26:45 AM] Ben Menyala: https://partners.circle.com/
[17/12/24, 9:26:54 AM] Ben Menyala: actually this could a list of potential partners
[17/12/24, 10:04:52 AM] Sandra Fortune: My goodness ! They have so many that they do a drop down
[17/12/24, 10:07:16 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahha
[17/12/24, 10:07:43 AM] Sandra Fortune: How old is HQ
[17/12/24, 10:08:07 AM] Ben Menyala: 2 years plus
[17/12/24, 10:08:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: Wow. If we could be as successful - will be awesome !
[17/12/24, 10:49:15 AM] Sandra Fortune: This Josh ah …. Vomit blood leh
[17/12/24, 10:50:17 AM] Sandra Fortune: And compliance also … damn jiat lat - give requirements that are so shitty 
They are so non compliant themselves
[17/12/24, 10:52:23 AM] Ben Menyala: lololol
[17/12/24, 11:11:46 AM] HengHongLee: hahaha
[17/12/24, 11:11:56 AM] HengHongLee: straitsx compliance is really bad one i remb
[17/12/24, 11:12:06 AM] HengHongLee: whos the compliance person name
[17/12/24, 11:12:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: Let me ask Josh
‎[17/12/24, 11:13:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[17/12/24, 11:13:15 AM] Sandra Fortune: Via email ! Seriously !
[17/12/24, 11:16:33 AM] HengHongLee: tell them we dont support email. only cd-rom
[17/12/24, 11:16:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahahah
[17/12/24, 11:16:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: Really man. This is getting ridiculous
[17/12/24, 11:17:13 AM] Ben Menyala: guess we can wait for tianwei to reply
[17/12/24, 11:17:18 AM] Ben Menyala: but we should send this to milind
[17/12/24, 11:17:19 AM] Ben Menyala: hahahah
[17/12/24, 11:17:22 AM] Ben Menyala: crazy man ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/24, 11:17:29 AM] Sandra Fortune: IKR !
[17/12/24, 11:18:23 AM] HengHongLee: this is definitely not travel rule
[17/12/24, 11:18:26 AM] HengHongLee: hahaha ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/24, 11:20:00 AM] HengHongLee: if you have people's nric can u send them 0.01sgd with message "use straitsx for cheaper remittance"
[17/12/24, 11:20:20 AM] HengHongLee: using paynow
[17/12/24, 11:20:43 AM] Ben Menyala: lmaoo
[17/12/24, 11:26:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - sending this Milind and Laura
[17/12/24, 11:26:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: Our SX contact has updated as follows :

“ both require both remittance slip and successful payment can be shared via email - the goal is to we want to show traceability that how much is promised to be paid is actually paid to the end beneficiary 

for the remittance slip, our understanding is that Ample would print a slip or show some evidence to their customer acknowledging: 
- Ample has received X amount of customer’s SGD cash 
- ⁠Will process for Y amount of PHP to be sent to the end beneficiary 

for the confirmation, understand that Xweave shows traceability of transaction - what type of information does Xweave provide to show that the fund is in the end-beneficiary account?”

We are still in discussions with SX to identify a more secure way of handling the data instead of manual email sending. 
We have also requested to engage SX’s compliance for a discussion to iron out requirements.
[17/12/24, 11:28:46 AM] Ben Menyala: you wanna send this via email?
[17/12/24, 11:31:07 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yes. 
I’ll send print screen on text as well
[17/12/24, 11:33:27 AM] HengHongLee: u all saw the acra news on nric?
[17/12/24, 11:40:03 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahah … NRIC is no longer PII Hahha or PDPA
[17/12/24, 11:40:14 AM] Sandra Fortune: And gov is supporting that
[17/12/24, 11:41:29 AM] Sandra Fortune: What outcome do we want. 
I want 
- sampling of transactions and not all. 
- ⁠data can be retrieved from KYC data and not on email or remittance slip
[17/12/24, 11:41:35 AM] Sandra Fortune: What about you guys
[17/12/24, 11:46:31 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh
[17/12/24, 11:46:46 AM] Ben Menyala: Issue is we have the batch feature now cos of their api limitations
[17/12/24, 11:47:10 AM] Ben Menyala: If they want us to pass the data in flight we may not be able to do that
[17/12/24, 11:48:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: So we need to be clear what we want. 
Milind is right - we don’t have clear asks and expected outcomes - so go to TW he wouldn’t know how to help as well
[17/12/24, 11:48:27 AM] Sandra Fortune: I wouldn’t want to change our flow - if don’t want to change - what will be best
[17/12/24, 11:48:42 AM] Sandra Fortune: Sampling on transactions and what data can we pull
[17/12/24, 11:49:00 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh just pass them sampling of transactions on request ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/24, 11:49:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: So it will be pass slips on pass word protected email on samples
[17/12/24, 11:50:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: So main battle is sampling and not all
[17/12/24, 11:51:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: Expected vol in pilot should be about 10 tnx a day ?
[17/12/24, 12:05:13 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh I think ard there
[17/12/24, 12:06:49 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. 
Is there an option to remove bundle .. 
but how do we do it - since it’s a csv origin
[17/12/24, 12:07:18 PM] Ben Menyala: We added bundle cos of their api limits
[17/12/24, 12:07:23 PM] HengHongLee: can we just send them the csv?
[17/12/24, 12:07:31 PM] HengHongLee: cannot bundle?
[17/12/24, 12:07:40 PM] HengHongLee: what did milind say about that i cant remb
[17/12/24, 12:07:52 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh actly we can send them the csv
[17/12/24, 12:08:17 PM] Ben Menyala: But man I dunno whether Ample will be too keen on that
[17/12/24, 12:08:32 PM] Ben Menyala: But ya I think pilot should be fine ba
[17/12/24, 12:10:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ah - that’s true. We can send them the CSv since they have everything 
But they also want us to send data on receiving end - when Bene recv it 🤨
‎[17/12/24, 12:10:10 PM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[17/12/24, 12:10:23 PM] Sandra Fortune: Realise that HH didn’t get to see this
[17/12/24, 12:10:25 PM] HengHongLee: we already breakdown the csv within our systems. we can just reorganize the info and send to them
[17/12/24, 12:10:27 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahaha
[17/12/24, 12:10:40 PM] Sandra Fortune: Depends if ample wants to do this
[17/12/24, 12:10:47 PM] HengHongLee: but shortly after the sending we will delete the PII so if want us to do we need to do during the transaction ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/24, 12:11:08 PM] Sandra Fortune: We need to get ample involve 

Josh is trying to set up something with compliance - we should involve ample
[17/12/24, 12:11:18 PM] HengHongLee: ya
[17/12/24, 12:13:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: So here are our options : 

1) we can send them all transaction data in the CSV file provided they can store it properly and securely 
- this need to check with ample if they are ok with it. 

2. We still insist on sampling (haha) - for this approach how to pull out the info ? Via csv as well ?
[17/12/24, 12:16:41 PM] HengHongLee: sampling means they will request after. for this they need to get it direct from ample because we dont save it
[17/12/24, 12:17:42 PM] HengHongLee: depends on how long after they want to sample
[17/12/24, 12:18:14 PM] HengHongLee: we might know the transaction refId so we can help map that
[17/12/24, 12:18:28 PM] Sandra Fortune: We immediately purge data in our systems when PDAX send out to bene org ?
[17/12/24, 12:18:50 PM] HengHongLee: theoratically yes
[17/12/24, 12:18:57 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok
[17/12/24, 12:19:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: So we need to send out options available now and what it means
[17/12/24, 12:21:38 PM] HengHongLee: https://fintechnews.sg/105204/blockchain/stablecoins-in-asia-are-reducing-usd-dependency/
[17/12/24, 12:22:20 PM] HengHongLee: re yesterday’s chat, i think we need to focus on other regional stablecoins
[17/12/24, 12:22:26 PM] HengHongLee: like this IDRT
[17/12/24, 12:22:32 PM] HengHongLee: or yen stablecoins
[17/12/24, 12:24:17 PM] HengHongLee: this IDRT has 10mil usd worth of liquidity on BSC
[17/12/24, 12:28:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Makes sense
[17/12/24, 12:29:30 PM] Ben Menyala: I think the best is 

On-ramp to sending country stable —> defi liquidity to receiving country stable —> off-ramp
[17/12/24, 12:29:39 PM] Ben Menyala: I think for this flow we might have a shot
[17/12/24, 12:29:41 PM] HengHongLee: we should go create on-off ramp account with whoever issuing this IDRT ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/24, 12:30:23 PM] Ben Menyala: For sampling  they will deal directly with ample
[17/12/24, 12:30:27 PM] HengHongLee: so we only can(should) go where that country have their own stablecoin ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/24, 12:30:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos ample does this alr
[17/12/24, 12:30:31 PM] Ben Menyala: For their partners
[17/12/24, 12:30:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh that was the conclusion we had last year as well
[17/12/24, 12:31:03 PM] HengHongLee: not just any shitty stablecoin tho. need to have deep enough liquidity
[17/12/24, 12:31:07 PM] HengHongLee: which is actually quite rare
[17/12/24, 12:31:19 PM] HengHongLee: why dont we do SGD/USD corridor ah
[17/12/24, 12:31:30 PM] HengHongLee: or SGD/EUR
[17/12/24, 12:31:39 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya I was thinking also actly
[17/12/24, 12:31:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos if we partner deeply with circle or paxos for their pyusd
[17/12/24, 12:31:54 PM] HengHongLee: https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins we need to pick from here
[17/12/24, 12:35:05 PM] HengHongLee: need to find stablecoin issuers that have banking offramp rails
[17/12/24, 12:39:38 PM] Sandra Fortune: They want data on receipt flow too - PDAX will have to provide ?
[17/12/24, 12:41:59 PM] Ben Menyala: We have that alr on our platform
[17/12/24, 12:42:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos we show it to Ample
[17/12/24, 12:42:57 PM] Sandra Fortune: But we don’t keep it.
So we can pull this out as plain data and send it over to SX on email …
[17/12/24, 12:43:39 PM] HengHongLee: depends on when they want it i guess
[17/12/24, 12:43:57 PM] HengHongLee: if they want it outside of our policies then they have to get it direct from Ample
[17/12/24, 12:44:12 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Then ample will have to get this
[17/12/24, 12:44:40 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha let me go try to engage independent reserve
[17/12/24, 12:44:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: Think it’s time for us to share updates in our ample chat group also
[17/12/24, 12:44:46 PM] Ben Menyala: StraitsX really a pain
[17/12/24, 12:44:51 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yes they are
[17/12/24, 12:45:11 PM] Ben Menyala: Hopefully tian Wei can talk some sense to their compliance team
[17/12/24, 12:45:35 PM] Ben Menyala: But actly compliance team just being safe
[17/12/24, 12:45:39 PM] Ben Menyala: So they can keep their jobs
[17/12/24, 12:45:58 PM] Sandra Fortune: Sampling is sufficient - no need all honestly ‎<This message was edited>
[17/12/24, 12:46:10 PM] HengHongLee: maybe need for travel rule compliance
[17/12/24, 12:46:11 PM] Sandra Fortune: Moreover - its external not internal
[17/12/24, 12:46:34 PM] HengHongLee: https://notabene.id/crypto-travel-rule-101/what-is-the-crypto-travel-rule
[17/12/24, 12:47:41 PM] HengHongLee: but they can always do travel rule with the business information
[17/12/24, 12:47:48 PM] HengHongLee: which should be the case in Ample
[17/12/24, 12:47:51 PM] Sandra Fortune: - as long as can demonstrate that it’s fulfilled that can pull out specific data - it’s good enough
[17/12/24, 12:48:10 PM] Sandra Fortune: They are too afraid of AML
[17/12/24, 12:48:38 PM] HengHongLee: ya coz once caught compliance person got career risk
[17/12/24, 12:48:46 PM] HengHongLee: kind of lame actually
[17/12/24, 12:49:40 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ya. But this OTT
‎[17/12/24, 12:58:29 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[17/12/24, 12:59:52 PM] HengHongLee: 50bps + $0.40
[17/12/24, 1:00:14 PM] HengHongLee: so expensive
[17/12/24, 1:01:44 PM] Sandra Fortune: Wow !
[17/12/24, 1:02:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Shaggg
[17/12/24, 1:02:25 PM] Ben Menyala: what’s happening with XIDR
[17/12/24, 1:02:26 PM] Ben Menyala: Lolol
[17/12/24, 1:02:36 PM] HengHongLee: lol u can ask straitsz
[17/12/24, 1:02:39 PM] HengHongLee: x
[17/12/24, 1:02:48 PM] HengHongLee: idk seems like no sound
[17/12/24, 1:03:10 PM] HengHongLee: from what i know from before its alr built finish
[17/12/24, 1:04:33 PM] HengHongLee: xsgd price actually is good
[17/12/24, 1:04:49 PM] HengHongLee: coz they alr got yield with the sgd
[17/12/24, 1:09:44 PM] Sandra Fortune: For this. They request up to bene receipt 
We will only receive up to PDAX sending money to specific bank/ wallet right. Not when bene say they receive
[17/12/24, 1:15:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’m creating this table cos just too much to fit in
[17/12/24, 1:15:36 PM] Ben Menyala: Pdax tells us whether it’s successful or not
‎[17/12/24, 1:16:19 PM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[17/12/24, 1:17:27 PM] Sandra Fortune: But that’s on whether PDAX has deposited money into the (for eg) Gcash
[17/12/24, 1:17:46 PM] Ben Menyala: yeahh we won't know
[17/12/24, 1:17:47 PM] Sandra Fortune: Or - PDAX puts directly into GCASH client’s account
[17/12/24, 1:17:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: 😬
[17/12/24, 1:17:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhahaha
[17/12/24, 1:18:04 PM] Ben Menyala: But they'll tell us it's done
[17/12/24, 1:18:22 PM] Ben Menyala: but we should be able to trust PDAX
[17/12/24, 1:18:49 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok.  Because compliance is asking tracibility all the way to bene
[17/12/24, 1:18:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: Not bene org
[17/12/24, 1:19:09 PM] Sandra Fortune: This is the time when I wish I have a compliance person
[17/12/24, 1:19:11 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahah
[17/12/24, 1:20:03 PM] Sandra Fortune: What are the fields PDAX’s confirmation ?  Just Completed base on our ReqID or TxnID.
[17/12/24, 1:21:15 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh
[17/12/24, 1:21:20 PM] Ben Menyala: They’ll return us status
[17/12/24, 1:21:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok.
[17/12/24, 1:21:57 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’ve updated the table
‎[17/12/24, 1:22:14 PM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[17/12/24, 1:22:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: Honestly we just need to confirm with ample if they are comfortable
[17/12/24, 1:26:49 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh but hahah it’s def not gonna sit well with the rest of the clients for sure
[17/12/24, 1:26:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Think this battle need to fight
[17/12/24, 1:27:07 PM] Ben Menyala: If not maybe straitsX might not be the correct partner beyond the pilot
[17/12/24, 1:27:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: Agree.
[17/12/24, 1:27:51 PM] Sandra Fortune: So the ask is really that even though we can provide we should not be doing it for all txn
[17/12/24, 1:35:45 PM] Sandra Fortune: Guys - I’m talking to QY now
‎[17/12/24, 1:36:19 PM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[17/12/24, 1:36:23 PM] Sandra Fortune: So naughty … SX
[17/12/24, 1:36:51 PM] Ben Menyala: Crazyyy
[17/12/24, 1:37:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: IKR !
[17/12/24, 1:54:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - going to edit the email to this :


A quick update on Ample’s onboarding process with Straits X.

Straits X Compliance has requested for the following for every transaction.
 1) Ample to share both remittance slip and successful payment via email.
 (Ample : Received X amount of customer’s SGD cash. Proceed with Y amount of PHP send to Beneficiary)

2) Xweave to share Confirmation data. What does Xweave provide to show that the funds are in end bene account.

There are several clarifications that we have on the above request, and they are as follows :
- Could SX indicate specific information required. (Will it be information that can be retrieved from the KYC data being sent for both Sende and Bene)
- Where will Straits X be storing this data (since this is PII Data) 
- How will SX be handling this data sent through by Ample (purge data once verified?)


While we work through the details of the data required to fulfill SX’s compliance policies, we acknowledge that sharing this data means Ample would also be sharing their clients' data.
This data was originally collected to deliver services to their clients, and sharing it further could be perceived as repurposing it for an additional use. This raises considerations around client confidentiality and data privacy.
To strike a balance between compliance and these sensitivities, we are requesting for a sampling approach, rather than reviewing all transactions. This would allow SX to meet its compliance obligations while minimizing the amount of client data being shared.
[17/12/24, 1:55:10 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’m trying to get away from every txn this is the main ask
And not send remit slips 
…
[17/12/24, 1:57:43 PM] Ben Menyala: yeahh makes sense -- how you want to send this
[17/12/24, 1:58:23 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’m going to send email to Milind - so he will ride on this to send to TW
[17/12/24, 1:58:29 PM] Ben Menyala: okay nice
[17/12/24, 1:58:34 PM] Ben Menyala: ya can
[17/12/24, 1:58:44 PM] Ben Menyala: TW probably is going to be key decision maker
[17/12/24, 1:58:49 PM] Ben Menyala: that can override this
[17/12/24, 1:59:00 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok cool - I’m going to send it
[17/12/24, 2:21:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - you got the invite for the Poland VASP ?
[17/12/24, 2:21:44 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ - you want to join - can suss them out also

[17/12/24, 2:55:19 PM] Sandra Fortune: Why is he sending to me in the first place ?
[17/12/24, 2:55:24 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’m not the one signing it
[17/12/24, 2:55:27 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahah
[17/12/24, 2:58:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: 😬let’s see what they have to say
[17/12/24, 2:58:45 PM] Sandra Fortune: Poland - but base on in ph - definitely something there - probably expanding to PH Hahha ‎<This message was edited>

[17/12/24, 6:38:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Did you get the solana phone this time  https://solanamobile.com/ @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[17/12/24, 10:06:15 PM] HengHongLee: haha i did...
[18/12/24, 10:49:12 AM] Praise: Heyyy. I’m at the door
[18/12/24, 11:05:09 AM] Sandra Fortune: You got in?
[18/12/24, 11:05:16 AM] Praise: Ah yea
[18/12/24, 11:05:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cool.
[19/12/24, 9:34:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hello guys.
A question on bundle. If one of the transactions is rejected, it wouldn’t crash the rest of the transactions in the bundle right? 
Only that one is flagged and money stays in PDAX and when it reaches x amount it gets returned to ample thru PDAX and Straits X and finally into Ample’s bank account ?
[19/12/24, 9:34:36 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩
[19/12/24, 9:34:41 AM] Praise: Yes
[19/12/24, 9:35:07 AM] Praise: The transactions are sent individually. And if one has issues. It doesn’t affect the rest.
[19/12/24, 9:35:14 AM] Sandra Fortune: How is it flagged - will ample, Straits X and PDAX know ?
[19/12/24, 9:35:32 AM] Praise: Flagged you mean kyc rejected?
[19/12/24, 9:36:05 AM] HengHongLee: if the bulk one fails then all fails
[19/12/24, 9:36:08 AM] Praise: We don’t have return mechanism tho
[19/12/24, 9:36:17 AM] Sandra Fortune: If the transaction is “rejected” - what are the error codes indicated today ? It could be base on any of those
[19/12/24, 9:36:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: Wait. So does all txn in the bulk fail together or only that one fails
[19/12/24, 9:38:19 AM] Praise: Sandra can I get the question right. 

We have different stages of the transaction 


- first stage from straistx when it’s batched. If there’s an issue there. The whole bundle fails. 
- ⁠the next stage is from pdax. The transactions are disbursed individually. If one of them has issues. It doesn’t affect the others
[19/12/24, 9:39:27 AM] Praise: _and when it reaches x amount it gets returned to ample thru PDAX and Straits X and finally into Ample’s bank account ?_

What do you mean by return?
[19/12/24, 9:40:38 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. This makes sense.
Is there an error code table that you guys are using to depict different errors/ rejects ?
[19/12/24, 9:41:17 AM] Praise: Right now we just keep retrying. Right? @⁨HengHongLee⁩  I need to confirm tho.
[19/12/24, 9:42:37 AM] Sandra Fortune: If the money has already moved to PDAX and during a wallet/bank check the money cannot be disbursed. 
It could be bene checks fail for various reasons

What then happens to the money 

Our original scope was to let the funds reside in PDAX and once accumulated to x amount, it goes back to Ample
[19/12/24, 9:43:18 AM] Praise: Manually right?
[19/12/24, 9:43:28 AM] HengHongLee: yes
[19/12/24, 9:43:35 AM] Sandra Fortune: Can you help confirm how the code is behaving so we will know how funds are handled
[19/12/24, 9:43:37 AM] HengHongLee: it just keeps retrying until success
[19/12/24, 9:44:07 AM] HengHongLee: i think currently theres just retrying and cancelled
[19/12/24, 9:44:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: So PDAX will continue to try. 
What happens when cancelled
[19/12/24, 9:44:33 AM] Praise: At the moment. We don’t have like handling of different scenarios
[19/12/24, 9:44:40 AM] Praise: The money just sits there
[19/12/24, 9:44:52 AM] Praise: Until manual intervention
[19/12/24, 9:44:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: So we don’t move the money back to ample
[19/12/24, 9:45:08 AM] HengHongLee: we have to
[19/12/24, 9:45:18 AM] HengHongLee: its semi automated
[19/12/24, 9:45:38 AM] Sandra Fortune: How will manual intervention look like 
PDAX break glass and send the money back into Ample SX account ? 
This is not part of the return process mapped out yet with PDAX
[19/12/24, 9:45:39 AM] HengHongLee: we basically use our own system to move it back
[19/12/24, 9:45:55 AM] Sandra Fortune: Is this what we want to do ?
If yes - we will need to keep PDAX updated
[19/12/24, 9:46:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: So we don’t need PDAX but we send instructions to PDAX to do it
[19/12/24, 9:46:35 AM] Sandra Fortune: If that is the case - then it’s good
[19/12/24, 9:46:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: In what condition will cancel be used
[19/12/24, 9:47:27 AM] Sandra Fortune: I’m doing the launch doc - Hahha - so wanting to match up reality vs what’s written in the return flow in the ops manual
[19/12/24, 10:29:56 AM] HengHongLee: when its unrecoverable or it is taking too long
[19/12/24, 10:30:20 AM] Sandra Fortune: If Ample say I want to take it back - is it allowed ?
[19/12/24, 10:30:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: And how long is too long
[19/12/24, 10:30:37 AM] HengHongLee: then cancel and send it back?
[19/12/24, 10:30:51 AM] HengHongLee: for example the chain congested might need to wait a few hrs?
[19/12/24, 10:31:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. So they need to tell us manually and give us instructions to do so
[19/12/24, 10:31:12 AM] Praise: Yes if it’s still pending. Can cancel and refund.
[19/12/24, 10:31:13 AM] HengHongLee: alot of reasons why it could fail
[19/12/24, 10:31:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hmmm… ok. 
We can set a number and fine tune it -
[19/12/24, 10:31:19 AM] HengHongLee: the rates also can be wrong
[19/12/24, 10:31:32 AM] HengHongLee: moved already for example
[19/12/24, 10:35:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok.
@⁨Praise⁩- I am going to share with you a doc - can you help me to look through it and confirm that it’s consistent with the dev piece ?

[26/12/24, 2:12:59 PM] HengHongLee: gonna try a live batched transaction to test out the flow

[26/12/24, 2:14:41 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh let me ask
[26/12/24, 2:14:49 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe failed kyc already
[26/12/24, 2:15:03 PM] HengHongLee: what does failed kyc mean
[26/12/24, 2:15:22 PM] HengHongLee: it already passed before
[26/12/24, 2:16:52 PM] Ben Menyala: Last time pdax didn’t do kyc
[26/12/24, 2:16:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos they depend on dragon
[26/12/24, 2:17:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Now they using their mtl
[26/12/24, 2:17:15 PM] HengHongLee: i using dragon’s account
[26/12/24, 2:17:20 PM] Ben Menyala: They’ll do the sanction screening and kyc checks I think
[26/12/24, 2:17:31 PM] Ben Menyala: But they doing the last mile distribution right
[26/12/24, 2:17:39 PM] Ben Menyala: So I think they’ll start doing the checks
[26/12/24, 2:17:43 PM] HengHongLee: ok
[26/12/24, 2:17:43 PM] Ben Menyala: Like in the ample flow
[26/12/24, 2:17:46 PM] Ben Menyala: They have to do the checks
[26/12/24, 2:17:52 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos it’s their PH license now
[26/12/24, 2:18:11 PM] HengHongLee: anyway its ready to test already
[26/12/24, 2:18:19 PM] HengHongLee: u can test if u got the accounts
[26/12/24, 2:18:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Yup I asking Ina to get the accounts
[26/12/24, 2:19:13 PM] Ben Menyala: Nicee once she gives us the accounts we can test alr
[26/12/24, 2:20:06 PM] Praise: So that means the money is stucked now with pdax?
[26/12/24, 2:20:19 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[26/12/24, 2:29:20 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ anyway withdraw from pdax usdcmatic is 10usdc each time. super ex. lets try to make it not get stuck there ‎<This message was edited>
‎[26/12/24, 2:30:11 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[26/12/24, 2:30:47 PM] HengHongLee: cant send back now, only left $0.49
[26/12/24, 2:32:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: Which account left 0.49 ?
[26/12/24, 2:33:10 PM] HengHongLee: i mean sending that 600php back to straitsx is $10
[26/12/24, 2:33:15 PM] HengHongLee: so left 0.49
[26/12/24, 2:33:27 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ahh. Ok
[26/12/24, 2:36:23 PM] Ben Menyala: I think we can nego for free refund flow
[26/12/24, 2:36:30 PM] Ben Menyala: They said they can do that for us ‎<This message was edited>
[26/12/24, 2:36:36 PM] Ben Menyala: But it’s okay now let’s leave it in pdax first
[26/12/24, 2:36:55 PM] HengHongLee: then we cant properly test the disbursement since it will use the money if its inside
[26/12/24, 2:37:04 PM] HengHongLee: something like that
[26/12/24, 2:37:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh
[26/12/24, 2:38:01 PM] Ben Menyala: Meaning the transaction might use a prior transaction’s money?
[26/12/24, 2:38:02 PM] HengHongLee: anyway its fine
[26/12/24, 2:38:05 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[26/12/24, 2:38:19 PM] HengHongLee: theres no reserving the money in the system
[26/12/24, 2:38:23 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh yeahh there’s the verify deposit piece right
[26/12/24, 2:38:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Last time was done by dragon
[26/12/24, 2:38:51 PM] Ben Menyala: I guess now we need to add that ourselves if our client owns the pdax account as well?
[26/12/24, 2:39:22 PM] HengHongLee: we can add the reserving part but that would require a bunch of designing
[26/12/24, 2:39:31 PM] HengHongLee: right now its fungible
[26/12/24, 2:40:10 PM] HengHongLee: anw now if u use dragon’s pdax account to test it will take from pdax usdcmatic account so its not an issue ‎<This message was edited>
[26/12/24, 2:40:42 PM] HengHongLee: since its not merged until the php step
[26/12/24, 2:40:48 PM] HengHongLee: but merged till the usdcmatic step
[26/12/24, 2:40:51 PM] HengHongLee: hard to explain
[26/12/24, 2:41:30 PM] Praise: Basically the disbursement starts from the swap. So it won’t use the existing money there
[26/12/24, 2:41:36 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ probably should write up a doc on how the merge works
[26/12/24, 2:41:44 PM] Praise: Ah. Can do that
[26/12/24, 2:44:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Basically
Xsgd —> usdc (bulk) 
Usdc —> pesos (split to single txn swaps for disbursement) 

So the verify deposit that dragon did doesn’t really work here right
[26/12/24, 2:44:57 PM] HengHongLee: yes it works
[26/12/24, 2:45:12 PM] HengHongLee: but only for pdax account that has dragonpay as owner
[26/12/24, 2:45:26 PM] HengHongLee: so if u use xweavesg
[26/12/24, 2:45:41 PM] HengHongLee: ur experience will be different from using ample with their own accounts
[26/12/24, 2:45:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos the usdc entered in bulk instead of single tho - they verify singly right
[26/12/24, 2:46:44 PM] Ben Menyala: So actly the verify deposit for bulk will be different anyway even if we use dragon
[26/12/24, 2:48:00 PM] HengHongLee: only if we use dragon. if pdax account not owned by dragon the merge will go all the way the pdax php account ‎<This message was edited>
[26/12/24, 2:48:20 PM] Ben Menyala: I see got it
[26/12/24, 2:48:23 PM] HengHongLee: the code knows how to special case
[26/12/24, 2:48:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Nice okayy ‎<This message was edited>
[26/12/24, 2:48:39 PM] HengHongLee: yeah @⁨Praise⁩ big brain
[26/12/24, 2:48:45 PM] Ben Menyala: LOL
[26/12/24, 2:48:49 PM] Ben Menyala: Sick
[26/12/24, 2:49:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay once I get some test accounts let’s run a few txns
[26/12/24, 2:49:10 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me ask Isabel too
[26/12/24, 2:51:25 PM] Praise: Haha. For dragonpay pdax account. The usdc doesn’t enter in bulk. We swap at the disbursement step
[26/12/24, 2:52:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Big brain
[26/12/24, 2:52:53 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ can start thinking about this transaction reservation thing alr
[26/12/24, 2:53:24 PM] Praise: Right. So it doesn’t use money that doesn’t belong to it right?
[26/12/24, 2:53:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Meaning the usdc is reserved for disbursing into pesos so it’s definitely clean right
[26/12/24, 2:53:56 PM] HengHongLee: yes this
[26/12/24, 2:54:07 PM] HengHongLee: cant use money from other transaction
[26/12/24, 3:15:49 PM] Sandra Fortune: This statement …. Most important 😬
[26/12/24, 3:16:17 PM] HengHongLee: the money is fungible. not that impt actually
[26/12/24, 3:16:35 PM] HengHongLee: but more for easier accounting and retrying
[26/12/24, 3:16:46 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh just another layer of checks and balances
[26/12/24, 3:17:06 PM] HengHongLee: basically another set of accounts and accounting
[26/12/24, 3:17:13 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yes.
[26/12/24, 4:27:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Actly sorry this is Ina’s real name haha @⁨HengHongLee⁩

[26/12/24, 4:47:59 PM] HengHongLee: not sure whats the error on their side
[26/12/24, 4:50:23 PM] Praise: Should we catch the error?
[26/12/24, 4:50:29 PM] Praise: Looks like we don’t catch it
[26/12/24, 4:58:35 PM] HengHongLee: we log it but its not sent to sentry
[26/12/24, 5:09:59 PM] HengHongLee: theres a retry object that isnt printed out properlyin their error
[26/12/24, 5:48:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Do you have it? We can send to their PM
[26/12/24, 5:50:22 PM] Ben Menyala: Tag you in the slack

[26/12/24, 6:03:19 PM] HengHongLee: ok
[26/12/24, 6:04:06 PM] HengHongLee: u can search for the identifier
[26/12/24, 6:04:17 PM] HengHongLee: which is the order id

[27/12/24, 10:51:57 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh we need their user name and password to get their pdax api keys - or can Matt do it hahaha I think Matt is technical enough to use terminal right
[27/12/24, 10:52:22 AM] HengHongLee: lets do that when we are at their office
[27/12/24, 10:52:33 AM] Ben Menyala: No one in their office tho
[27/12/24, 10:52:46 AM] HengHongLee: i thought we going to ample next wk?
[27/12/24, 10:52:48 AM] Ben Menyala: All their ppl on leave haha
[27/12/24, 10:52:57 AM] Ben Menyala: That’s what matt said here
[27/12/24, 10:53:00 AM] Ben Menyala: Monday they still on leave
[27/12/24, 10:53:06 AM] Ben Menyala: Or is Matt there or we can go find him
[27/12/24, 10:53:13 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ya. They still on leave on Monday
[27/12/24, 10:53:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: Think he prefers to do it offline
[27/12/24, 10:53:39 AM] Sandra Fortune: But I told him we will be available if we need any help
[27/12/24, 10:53:40 AM] HengHongLee: ah hmm ok we can do a call i guess
[27/12/24, 10:53:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah ….
[27/12/24, 10:54:22 AM] HengHongLee: i'd prefer that we dont handle the credentials directly let them input into the system
[27/12/24, 10:54:30 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya true
[27/12/24, 10:54:56 AM] Ben Menyala: I have the instructions in my deck but haha need Matt to make a curl request
[27/12/24, 10:55:05 AM] HengHongLee: why need curl request
[27/12/24, 10:55:36 AM] Ben Menyala: To get pdax api keys need to curl request with username and password if you rmb
[27/12/24, 10:55:44 AM] Ben Menyala: They don’t have the api keys in the dashboard
[27/12/24, 10:55:56 AM] HengHongLee: no need just put the login and password into the xweave integrations page
[27/12/24, 10:56:11 AM] HengHongLee: pdax api keys are not persistant
[27/12/24, 10:56:19 AM] HengHongLee: they need to be refreshed
[27/12/24, 10:56:39 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh we call for them ah
[27/12/24, 10:56:47 AM] HengHongLee: but they can always "roll" the keys by resetting their pw
[27/12/24, 10:56:57 AM] Ben Menyala: We have that feature now?
[27/12/24, 10:57:06 AM] HengHongLee: they can roll it on pdax website
[27/12/24, 10:57:29 AM] HengHongLee: basically pdax doesnt have api keys they only have session tokens
[27/12/24, 10:58:15 AM] Ben Menyala: So they input the username and password into xweave integrations page and we get the session tokens for them?
[27/12/24, 10:58:21 AM] HengHongLee: yah
[27/12/24, 10:58:33 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay nice then they no need to do the curl request themselves a lot simpler
[27/12/24, 10:58:39 AM] Ben Menyala: Let me update the instructions manual
[27/12/24, 10:58:52 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahah … oh man. I just send to Matt.

[27/12/24, 11:54:51 AM] Ben Menyala: Let me update those fields
[27/12/24, 11:55:26 AM] Ben Menyala: All fields compulsory?
[27/12/24, 11:55:28 AM] HengHongLee: and some of those fields have options
[27/12/24, 11:55:29 AM] HengHongLee: yes
[27/12/24, 11:55:33 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay
[27/12/24, 11:56:29 AM] HengHongLee: this is not well thought out
[27/12/24, 11:56:43 AM] HengHongLee: because >50k php will have additional fields
[27/12/24, 11:56:51 AM] Ben Menyala: I see
[27/12/24, 11:57:02 AM] Ben Menyala: It’s okay all txns will be below 50k php

[27/12/24, 11:57:46 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ample sending real txn so will not have $1 txn
[27/12/24, 11:57:55 AM] HengHongLee: ```

[27/12/24, 11:58:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh - 50k I read it as 50
[27/12/24, 11:59:00 AM] HengHongLee: i feel like we need to build a csv editor
[27/12/24, 12:00:03 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh maybe - think that’ll help with the fields validation
[27/12/24, 12:00:39 PM] HengHongLee: because the validation will drive them crazy if they dont get to edit the csv and have validations
[27/12/24, 12:00:55 PM] Sandra Fortune: Guys - we haven’t given Matt access to Xweave platform right
[27/12/24, 12:00:56 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha yeah

[27/12/24, 12:02:22 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok can.
[27/12/24, 12:02:27 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah …
[27/12/24, 12:02:31 PM] HengHongLee: also its messy. if u try to generate quotes for csv without integrations setup it will give u useless error “unable to generate quote"
[27/12/24, 12:02:36 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh
[27/12/24, 12:04:07 PM] HengHongLee: ok at least it gets `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'apiCredential')`

[27/12/24, 4:31:33 PM] Ben Menyala: I’ll check after
[27/12/24, 4:31:43 PM] Ben Menyala: By the time straitsX api is ready we should be ok already

[27/12/24, 4:32:17 PM] Ben Menyala: Ample so nice to us

[27/12/24, 4:37:52 PM] Ben Menyala: it's the rates also
[27/12/24, 4:37:59 PM] Ben Menyala: they need to configure the 20bps rates
[27/12/24, 4:38:04 PM] Ben Menyala: maybe their guy on leave
[27/12/24, 4:38:34 PM] Ben Menyala: so the other tech guy not on leave don't know how to configure
[27/12/24, 4:38:35 PM] Ben Menyala: hahaha
[27/12/24, 4:38:49 PM] Ben Menyala: but this kind feels like it should be already productized though
[27/12/24, 4:38:52 PM] Ben Menyala: don't get why so hard
[27/12/24, 4:38:58 PM] Ben Menyala: how can give an API key that doesn't work

[27/12/24, 6:02:00 PM] HengHongLee: we cant test coz of this issue
[27/12/24, 6:02:55 PM] HengHongLee: should have waited for me before executing
[27/12/24, 6:04:05 PM] HengHongLee: ok im going to just zero out that account for now and we can then test
[27/12/24, 6:04:12 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ can you create the bundle again
[27/12/24, 6:04:27 PM] Praise: Create but don’t execute?
[27/12/24, 6:04:42 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[27/12/24, 6:04:47 PM] HengHongLee: coz i still need to turn off paraswap

[27/12/24, 6:06:56 PM] Praise: Yea different amounts between 700-800
[27/12/24, 6:07:02 PM] Praise: Ok 5 then let me upload another
[27/12/24, 6:07:08 PM] HengHongLee: can it be smaller than 700?
[27/12/24, 6:07:15 PM] HengHongLee: did you figure out what was the issue with the 700?
[27/12/24, 6:08:38 PM] Praise: Isn’t that the minimum of 10 from Straitsx?
[27/12/24, 6:09:08 PM] HengHongLee: yes but if u merge it will go past the limit right?
[27/12/24, 6:09:15 PM] Praise: Oh. I see what you mean
[27/12/24, 6:09:32 PM] HengHongLee: i think its with the inidivudal quotes before merge
[27/12/24, 6:09:41 PM] Praise: Yes the reason is the get quote takes just one item
[27/12/24, 6:09:43 PM] HengHongLee: its ok nevermind just go with 700-800
[27/12/24, 6:09:49 PM] HengHongLee: we really need to test this at least 1 time

[27/12/24, 7:15:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay! Just went out for dinner so won’t be so fast
[27/12/24, 7:19:26 PM] HengHongLee: ok i gonna head home
[27/12/24, 7:20:33 PM] Ben Menyala: Thanks for all the engineering firepower @⁨Praise⁩ @⁨HengHongLee⁩ 🫡🫡
[27/12/24, 7:22:49 PM] Sandra Fortune: Thank you so much guys.
No first transaction but definitely great job !!!
[27/12/24, 7:23:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha and we made Ina richer too
[27/12/24, 7:23:37 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhahaha …..
[27/12/24, 7:23:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: Have a good dinner boys
[28/12/24, 8:05:08 AM] Ben Menyala: Joshua sent me a very long text 🤣🤣
[28/12/24, 8:05:18 AM] Ben Menyala: think they got hammered after milind’s message
[28/12/24, 8:05:20 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha
[28/12/24, 8:05:58 AM] Ben Menyala: That’s why they did it at 1am ytd
[28/12/24, 8:11:10 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh. What did he say
[28/12/24, 8:11:35 AM] Sandra Fortune: He send you long text when you ask him root problem 
First time see him text so long and I like the details on it
[28/12/24, 8:11:49 AM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣

[28/12/24, 8:12:49 AM] Ben Menyala: I asked him if we need milind to have a chat with TW to unblock him (but that’s before milind decided to send a message to TW)
[28/12/24, 8:13:03 AM] Ben Menyala: Really novel and revolutionary case 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[28/12/24, 8:13:12 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahah …. Oh man
[28/12/24, 8:13:27 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha shots were fired for sure
[28/12/24, 8:17:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: Wow so long … hahah - I shall read it when I go breakfast later with my little one
[28/12/24, 8:27:32 AM] Ben Menyala: hahahah enjoy!!
[28/12/24, 8:44:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: Wow. But honestly … Zack should have been unblocking all these for him. He reports to Zack I believe. 
I think they have really underestimated us and believe that we will not live so quickly
[28/12/24, 8:47:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: And I feel that his turn around for updates is non existence. 
He could have just drop a short 1 or 2 liner like - guys. Engaging xxxx now - shall give more and do freq updates
[28/12/24, 8:48:29 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cases that goes into such a tangent - really needs to be managed this way. Shit will always happen , it’s a matter of how it’s being managed. 
I feel that in the note - his really just saying we are borderline harassing and behaving badly 

But that just being me - the piss off and touche Sandra in this situation 😬
[28/12/24, 8:55:14 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha he’s probably still early in his career - usually you won’t send such a message to a partner
[28/12/24, 8:55:54 AM] Ben Menyala: But it’s okay we know going to the top works very well 🤣
[28/12/24, 8:56:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: As a newbie - he should self reflect what went wrong. Not tell a partner such things. My goodness.
[28/12/24, 8:58:29 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah.
I hate to escalate - but I’ve done nothing but chase and escalate for the whole week. Record breaking man …. That probably exceeded my entire quota of chasers over 20 years professional career!
[28/12/24, 8:59:06 AM] Ben Menyala: LOLLL!! 🤣
[28/12/24, 9:00:35 AM] Sandra Fortune: Really man. It’s really tiring ….

[28/12/24, 11:09:22 AM] HengHongLee: i need to create new org for api key testing
[28/12/24, 11:09:32 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh why lehh
[28/12/24, 11:09:34 AM] HengHongLee: we keep turning off paraswap on xweavesg
[28/12/24, 11:09:42 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohhh
[28/12/24, 11:09:42 AM] HengHongLee: my data collection not working 😂
[28/12/24, 11:09:47 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha oooopsss
[28/12/24, 11:10:11 AM] Ben Menyala: They really spiked our rates before our pilot
[28/12/24, 11:10:18 AM] Ben Menyala: Lmaooo
[28/12/24, 11:10:32 AM] Ben Menyala: Or maybe usdc liquidity is shit cos of crypto markets
[28/12/24, 11:10:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: I hope it’s not by design
[28/12/24, 11:10:39 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahaha
[28/12/24, 11:10:45 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha 80 bps
[28/12/24, 11:10:47 AM] Ben Menyala: How to do business
[28/12/24, 11:10:52 AM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣😅
[28/12/24, 11:11:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: Goodness. Too high ! Crazy
[28/12/24, 2:33:33 PM] Praise: Wow. That’s some long ass message
[28/12/24, 2:34:32 PM] Praise: But I really hope TW keeps having our back else these guys won’t mind to step on us if things goes south
[29/12/24, 9:14:27 AM] HengHongLee: someone started the batch right
[29/12/24, 9:14:30 AM] HengHongLee: theres some errors
[29/12/24, 9:15:03 AM] HengHongLee: `beneficiary_middle_name is required` somehow it sometimes needs this
[29/12/24, 9:16:29 AM] Ben Menyala: hahaha ya it's me
[29/12/24, 9:16:33 AM] Ben Menyala: i running my test case
[29/12/24, 9:16:42 AM] Ben Menyala: I think we need validation at csv upload step
[29/12/24, 9:16:46 AM] Ben Menyala: it's on purpose
[29/12/24, 9:16:46 AM] Ben Menyala: hahaha
[29/12/24, 9:17:01 AM] HengHongLee: whats on purpose
[29/12/24, 9:17:08 AM] Ben Menyala: as in leaving out the middle name
[29/12/24, 9:17:34 AM] Ben Menyala: Wanted to see what happens if Ample leave that out
[29/12/24, 9:17:39 AM] HengHongLee: ah ok
[29/12/24, 9:17:48 AM] HengHongLee: let me double check the kyc requirements
[29/12/24, 9:17:50 AM] Ben Menyala: it goes through all the way until PDAX throws error
[29/12/24, 9:18:26 AM] HengHongLee: it should be required already as per kyc validation @⁨Praise⁩
‎[29/12/24, 9:18:42 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[29/12/24, 9:19:50 AM] Ben Menyala: I am trying a few things 
1. Reference ID not unique --> prevents me from uploading the csv so that's good, but it shows "Error" without actual error message 
2. Leave a field blank (e.g. Middle name blank) --> It goes all the way through , and then fails at pdax disbursement step -> should have prevented me from uploading the csv and executing quote
‎[29/12/24, 9:21:01 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[29/12/24, 9:21:58 AM] HengHongLee: i think it needs to be modify-able and download-able
[29/12/24, 9:22:03 AM] HengHongLee: and have validations inline
[29/12/24, 9:22:13 AM] Ben Menyala: ya true that'll be the best actly
[29/12/24, 9:22:28 AM] Ben Menyala: if we can have the error column and then the error code so they can be modifiable
‎[29/12/24, 9:22:30 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[29/12/24, 9:22:40 AM] Ben Menyala: btw this one -- the workflow won't auto cancel right
[29/12/24, 9:22:43 AM] Ben Menyala: it'll keep retrying?
[29/12/24, 9:24:02 AM] HengHongLee: yes it will keep retrying
[29/12/24, 9:24:34 AM] HengHongLee: i will cancel it. also adding a non-retryable error when it has “xxx is required”
[29/12/24, 9:25:30 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay 👍
[29/12/24, 9:28:05 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha I really like how our batching helps us circumvent the xsgd to usdc minimum swap limit 🤣
[29/12/24, 9:30:00 AM] HengHongLee: i think there was an error message but think it failed
[29/12/24, 9:30:25 AM] HengHongLee: https://xweave.sentry.io/issues/6183462805/?environment=production&project=4507701419704320&query=is%3Aunresolved%20is%3Afor_review&referrer=issue-stream&sort=date&statsPeriod=14d&stream_index=0 @⁨Praise⁩
[29/12/24, 9:30:35 AM] HengHongLee: yeah this is good
[29/12/24, 9:30:48 AM] Ben Menyala: Oh yeah will our batching handle the xsgd —> usdc max swap limit
[29/12/24, 9:31:12 AM] HengHongLee: it will also handle usdc -> php swap limit actually
[29/12/24, 9:31:30 AM] HengHongLee: but disbursement limit is still 200php
[29/12/24, 9:31:58 AM] HengHongLee: 210 actually since 10 is the fee
[29/12/24, 9:32:13 AM] Ben Menyala: How about max swap limits
[29/12/24, 9:33:23 AM] Ben Menyala: Eg if there are 1000 txns of $500 sgd , our batching probably can’t do 500k xsgd to usdc swap right ‎<This message was edited>
[29/12/24, 9:33:42 AM] HengHongLee: dont think those are dealt with now
[29/12/24, 9:34:33 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay got it let me note down
[29/12/24, 9:34:51 AM] Ben Menyala: StraitsX might make the max swap limit account specific too
[29/12/24, 9:35:01 AM] Ben Menyala: So might have to be a configurable parameter on each account
[29/12/24, 9:35:03 AM] HengHongLee: anyway the straitsx deposit done with compliance
[29/12/24, 9:35:03 AM] Ben Menyala: I think
[29/12/24, 9:35:34 AM] HengHongLee: i think in this case its easier to work on it on the straitsx side
[29/12/24, 9:35:40 AM] HengHongLee: no point us splitting it
[29/12/24, 9:35:43 AM] HengHongLee: we just validate
[29/12/24, 9:36:35 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay actually I think with our csv row limit we’ll prevent this already
[29/12/24, 9:36:49 AM] HengHongLee: something like “Error: your straitsx account is not configured for >50k transactions”
[29/12/24, 9:37:23 AM] Ben Menyala: If we limit to 50 rows per csv and each txn is less than 1K
[29/12/24, 9:37:32 AM] Ben Menyala: We will not hit the 50k xsgd to usdc case
[29/12/24, 9:38:15 AM] Ben Menyala: Cos imagine they have 100 rows of 1k (even though they deposit 50k twice and straitsX deposit compliance didn’t catch them) then we’ll have a problem ‎<This message was edited>
[29/12/24, 9:41:55 AM] HengHongLee: yeah im not super worried about the upper limit now
[29/12/24, 9:59:21 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha yeah anyway that will be a good problem to have
[29/12/24, 10:00:25 AM] Praise: Hmmm. This shouldn’t be possible tho. Haha. There are 2 checks both at the upload and at the execute to check these fields. But I’ll take a look and see how that happened.
[29/12/24, 10:00:38 AM] Praise: Right
[29/12/24, 10:01:31 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay - yeahh I can send you the test csv later if you need when im back home
[29/12/24, 10:03:50 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Praise⁩ - super late night for you !
[29/12/24, 10:04:19 AM] Praise: Haha. Yea idk why I woke up. Going back to bed
[29/12/24, 10:04:33 AM] HengHongLee: haha yeah u can take a look at it later
[29/12/24, 10:04:50 AM] Praise: Sure !
[29/12/24, 10:06:16 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha oh no it’s 4am
[29/12/24, 10:06:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: Thanks Praise. Sleep well.
[29/12/24, 10:06:38 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh not urgent we’ll do a double check before ample uploads csv
[29/12/24, 10:06:48 AM] Sandra Fortune: Guys. Morning. 
Let’s make a list of non retry-ables later on
[29/12/24, 10:06:48 AM] Ben Menyala: So won’t have this issue
[29/12/24, 10:49:36 AM] HengHongLee: i think its cause the system doesnt detect that empty string in middle name is a missing field
‎[29/12/24, 2:45:11 PM] Ben Menyala: test_bundle3.csv ‎document omitted
[29/12/24, 3:05:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Ran a 25 row CSV -- all went through except 1 that got stuck

[29/12/24, 3:07:04 PM] HengHongLee: i saw an error for a callback in sentry
[29/12/24, 3:07:58 PM] Ben Menyala: I see
[29/12/24, 3:08:33 PM] HengHongLee: might not be us later i see
[29/12/24, 3:08:39 PM] HengHongLee: hard to read on my phone
[29/12/24, 3:08:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe Ina’s bank flag us
[29/12/24, 3:09:06 PM] Ben Menyala: 😅😅

[29/12/24, 3:13:59 PM] HengHongLee: hmm but thats a deposit
[29/12/24, 3:14:28 PM] HengHongLee: and the id is not right
[29/12/24, 3:14:34 PM] HengHongLee: i think we missing a callback from pdax
[29/12/24, 3:16:14 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe pdax api issue will check w them tmr
[29/12/24, 3:16:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya such a case we actly won’t know if the money got through right
[29/12/24, 3:17:05 PM] HengHongLee: later i will see the logs i cant tell from my phone
[29/12/24, 3:17:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Okk
[29/12/24, 4:32:11 PM] HengHongLee: ok just checked, cant find the callback
[29/12/24, 4:32:17 PM] HengHongLee: probably missing from pdax
‎[29/12/24, 4:40:45 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[29/12/24, 4:40:51 PM] HengHongLee: indeed, it is still pending on their side
[29/12/24, 4:45:29 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay will ask them on Monday
[29/12/24, 4:46:35 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe we made too many small deposits in a short time it triggered Ina’s bank to block it lolol
[29/12/24, 4:50:15 PM] Sandra Fortune: Could be
And most likely going thru another sanctions cycle - it does happen. 
And who knows - tomorrow morning those will be unblock
[29/12/24, 4:52:00 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh let’s see
[29/12/24, 4:52:21 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha tmr we ask pdax we prolly will know
[29/12/24, 4:59:37 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok sounds good. 
I’m heading to office tomorrow. See ya guys
[29/12/24, 5:02:03 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay - our first txn at 10.30?
[29/12/24, 5:02:14 PM] Ben Menyala: I’ll be there at 10 then
[29/12/24, 5:10:51 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - for now - it’s 10.30
[29/12/24, 5:10:59 PM] Sandra Fortune: No rejects from wallets ?
[29/12/24, 5:43:58 PM] Ben Menyala: let me test
[29/12/24, 5:44:04 PM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ is destbank PHBANK also for ewallet?
[29/12/24, 5:44:13 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[29/12/24, 6:05:30 PM] Ben Menyala: okay gcash works too
[29/12/24, 6:05:38 PM] Ben Menyala: just tested
[29/12/24, 6:06:25 PM] Ben Menyala: sorry there was a failed workflow on temporal cos my excel auto removed the first 0 from the gcash account number so it failed
[29/12/24, 6:06:57 PM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ need your help to cancel
[29/12/24, 6:07:39 PM] HengHongLee: there are 3 running jobs
[29/12/24, 6:07:57 PM] HengHongLee: cancel 2? since 1 of them is from just now still waiting
[29/12/24, 6:08:08 PM] HengHongLee: “Gcash beneficiary account number is not valid"
[29/12/24, 6:08:10 PM] Ben Menyala: all can cancel alr
[29/12/24, 6:08:14 PM] Ben Menyala: yeahh this one^
[29/12/24, 6:08:33 PM] HengHongLee: ok cancelled
[29/12/24, 6:08:39 PM] Ben Menyala: nice thnaks
[29/12/24, 6:09:07 PM] Ben Menyala: the other gcash one with the correct number went through
[29/12/24, 6:09:11 PM] Ben Menyala: all good
[29/12/24, 6:09:16 PM] Sandra Fortune: Cool. 
That means it’s the banks sanctions or cash management system catching it. 
Should you thru tomorrow for the bank account ones
[29/12/24, 6:09:34 PM] Ben Menyala: i sent another one to the same bank acct
[29/12/24, 6:09:35 PM] Ben Menyala: works tho
[29/12/24, 6:09:42 PM] Ben Menyala: so maybe it's just pdax issue
[29/12/24, 6:09:51 PM] Ben Menyala: they don't give us callback so we don't know the failed reason
[29/12/24, 6:10:05 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oooh.Maybe hitting same accent too many times
[29/12/24, 6:10:27 PM] Ben Menyala: yeahh maybe we triggered sth on pdax side
[29/12/24, 6:10:30 PM] Ben Menyala: not sure
[29/12/24, 6:10:34 PM] Ben Menyala: tmr ask them
[29/12/24, 6:10:46 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah
[29/12/24, 6:11:29 PM] Ben Menyala: Actly good thing we start off with the csv use case ‎<This message was edited>
[29/12/24, 6:11:42 PM] Ben Menyala: If api one probably will be more nightmarish to start with
[29/12/24, 6:13:20 PM] Ben Menyala: Seeing the batching and splitting of disbursement in real time is quite satisfying lmaoo
[29/12/24, 6:13:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Nice work on making it parallel haha @⁨Praise⁩ @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[29/12/24, 6:13:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah. Good that we went in this direction

[30/12/24, 9:15:10 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ pdax callbacks are all fully not working
[30/12/24, 9:17:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Thought there’s only one
[30/12/24, 9:17:51 PM] Ben Menyala: What are the other callbacks
[30/12/24, 9:18:17 PM] HengHongLee: crypto deposit and fiat withdraw callbacks
[30/12/24, 9:18:37 PM] Ben Menyala: Wait crypto deposit also?
[30/12/24, 9:18:50 PM] HengHongLee: its wierd they didnt seem to know its down so i thought only one off
[30/12/24, 9:19:19 PM] HengHongLee: but i didnt get any callbacks when testing with praise in the last couple of hrs
[30/12/24, 9:19:52 PM] HengHongLee: so pretty sure its a wider issue on their side
‎[30/12/24, 9:21:51 PM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[30/12/24, 9:21:57 PM] Ben Menyala: Do we need them to whitelist anything like last time?
[30/12/24, 9:22:17 PM] Ben Menyala: Prod ip address is the same right
[30/12/24, 9:22:56 PM] HengHongLee: i was thinking about that but they should have already whitelisted ius
[30/12/24, 9:22:57 PM] HengHongLee: us
[30/12/24, 9:23:14 PM] Sandra Fortune: Maybe just ask them again
[30/12/24, 9:23:17 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me test sending money on our xweave account?
[30/12/24, 9:23:22 PM] HengHongLee: yeah i just messaged into the slack group
[30/12/24, 9:23:22 PM] Sandra Fortune: And confirm that we are on the same URL
[30/12/24, 9:23:58 PM] HengHongLee: u can try sending to pdax from straitsx (without paraswap)
[30/12/24, 9:24:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Ok
[30/12/24, 9:24:46 PM] HengHongLee: dont swap at pdax yet. we still fixing stuff there
[30/12/24, 9:24:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Ok
[30/12/24, 9:25:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh ya one more issue

[30/12/24, 9:25:57 PM] Ben Menyala: Lmaooo
[30/12/24, 9:26:14 PM] HengHongLee: ah yes you will hit that issue here

[30/12/24, 9:31:32 PM] Ben Menyala: Can
[30/12/24, 9:31:37 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me know after you deploy
[30/12/24, 9:32:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe we need web2 rails for backup 🤣
[30/12/24, 9:32:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Plug into wise or sth so when vasps down we still can send
[30/12/24, 9:34:21 PM] HengHongLee: hmm maybe something wrong on our side. let me debug furthur this straitsx issue
[30/12/24, 9:34:26 PM] HengHongLee: let me check
‎[31/12/24, 12:30:25 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[31/12/24, 12:30:33 AM] HengHongLee: just re-tested this. still no pdax callbacks
[31/12/24, 12:30:56 AM] HengHongLee: this is from straitsx,sgd  to pdax,usdcmatic
[31/12/24, 12:31:58 AM] Ben Menyala: need to wait for pdax to get back to us  tmr
[31/12/24, 12:32:06 AM] HengHongLee: yeah
[31/12/24, 12:32:17 AM] Ben Menyala: We not doing polling yet right
[31/12/24, 12:32:33 AM] HengHongLee: no
[31/12/24, 1:17:11 AM] Sandra Fortune: So it’s PDAX issue. 😬
[31/12/24, 1:17:26 AM] Sandra Fortune: And they are an hour behind us - not sure if they can work on it so fast ….
[31/12/24, 1:18:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: And it’s only us…
[31/12/24, 1:24:45 AM] HengHongLee: this one isnt straitsx. the initial error (when we called zixuan is still correct) but its that their error got cached in our system. its fixed now ‎<This message was edited>
[31/12/24, 1:30:24 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh I see

‎[31/12/24, 8:28:58 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[31/12/24, 8:29:10 AM] HengHongLee: yes we always can
[31/12/24, 8:29:16 AM] HengHongLee: but not for sending out fiat
[31/12/24, 8:29:52 AM] HengHongLee: because this one is crypto topup, which is pdax recv, the next event after is pdax verifyRecv
[31/12/24, 8:30:10 AM] HengHongLee: https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/fortune.gojhm/workflows/cd5687ad-f5c1-4e63-b295-999ae7c333ae/6a3efdc7-02ce-4cf8-b824-c71e8e1df838/history im trying this out now
[31/12/24, 8:31:53 AM] HengHongLee: yup still down
[31/12/24, 8:32:24 AM] Ben Menyala: so the fiat withdrawal callback works cos we managed to do the fiat payout here?
[31/12/24, 8:32:45 AM] HengHongLee: no the fiat withdrawal doesnt work
[31/12/24, 8:32:50 AM] HengHongLee: only crypto topup works like that
[31/12/24, 8:33:06 AM] HengHongLee: coz the fiat withdrawal next event is phbank verifyrecv
[31/12/24, 8:33:09 AM] HengHongLee: which does nothing
[31/12/24, 8:33:43 AM] Ben Menyala: ohh i see
[31/12/24, 8:33:44 AM] Ben Menyala: okay
[31/12/24, 8:35:38 AM] Sandra Fortune: We will still need PDAx to let us know right for this one
[31/12/24, 8:35:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh. I saw Ben’s note already Hahha
[31/12/24, 8:36:18 AM] HengHongLee: eh i will look into the polling one for now, lets work in parallel to make sure we have pdax callbacks back up
[31/12/24, 8:36:28 AM] Ben Menyala: yeapp
[31/12/24, 8:36:33 AM] Ben Menyala: i pinged andrew again
[31/12/24, 9:27:03 AM] HengHongLee: ok gonna try push a change that does the polling stuff
[31/12/24, 9:27:18 AM] HengHongLee: might need a few go’s to stablize it
[31/12/24, 9:44:40 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ did you start this one? https://cloud.temporal.io/namespaces/fortune.gojhm/workflows/cd5687ad-f5c1-4e63-b295-999ae7c333ae/6a3efdc7-02ce-4cf8-b824-c71e8e1df838/history
[31/12/24, 9:45:04 AM] HengHongLee: oh that was me also
[31/12/24, 9:48:42 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya I didn’t start any
[31/12/24, 9:55:27 AM] Ben Menyala: ‘Could it be that that we can't use the same URL for callback for 2 different accounts ? ‘ — should we try registering a placeholder callback url for ample first and see if our menyala one will work?
[31/12/24, 9:55:33 AM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[31/12/24, 9:55:51 AM] HengHongLee: nah
[31/12/24, 9:56:02 AM] HengHongLee: it worked before. doesnt make sense it dont work now
[31/12/24, 9:56:28 AM] Ben Menyala: We haven’t had 2 accts using same callback though
[31/12/24, 9:56:43 AM] HengHongLee: hmm
[31/12/24, 9:56:45 AM] Ben Menyala: Maybe pdax side does unique checks?
[31/12/24, 9:56:55 AM] HengHongLee: maybe
[31/12/24, 9:56:56 AM] Ben Menyala: Then it threw error there
[31/12/24, 9:57:07 AM] HengHongLee: k let me try that
[31/12/24, 9:57:08 AM] Ben Menyala: I think worth trying
[31/12/24, 9:57:11 AM] Ben Menyala: Okk
[31/12/24, 10:20:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: should I start sending on Remit AI or hold off first ?
[31/12/24, 10:21:15 AM] Ben Menyala: I think can do their kyc first
[31/12/24, 10:21:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: ok. let me try. I've not used it before hahha
[31/12/24, 10:21:56 AM] Ben Menyala: Actly no harm sending cos they going to give the txn to us to execute anyway hahaha
[31/12/24, 10:21:59 AM] HengHongLee: our system doesnt work yet with out the polling
[31/12/24, 10:22:26 AM] Ben Menyala: We able to deploy the polling today?
[31/12/24, 10:22:43 AM] HengHongLee: yeah but i need to stablilize it first
[31/12/24, 10:22:49 AM] Ben Menyala: Okk
[31/12/24, 10:22:51 AM] Sandra Fortune: ok.
[31/12/24, 10:22:58 AM] Ben Menyala: This one not an issue right
[31/12/24, 10:22:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: i'll just play around with the Remit.AI first.
[31/12/24, 10:23:04 AM] Ben Menyala: Okayy
[31/12/24, 10:23:07 AM] Ben Menyala: You in office?

[31/12/24, 4:16:01 PM] HengHongLee: for the old txns that we did yesterday
[31/12/24, 4:16:22 PM] Praise: Oh, So it should get tied together with the bundle rihgt?
[31/12/24, 4:16:26 PM] Praise: I thought of that too
[31/12/24, 4:17:50 PM] Praise: It’s not tied to the bundle on the bundle page tho
[31/12/24, 4:21:39 PM] Ben Menyala: Hey @⁨Praise⁩
‎[31/12/24, 4:21:41 PM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[31/12/24, 4:21:49 PM] Ben Menyala: why is the difference and rate diff for this txn different
[31/12/24, 4:22:30 PM] Praise: Hmm, That’s weird. Taking a look
[31/12/24, 4:22:37 PM] Ben Menyala: okk

[31/12/24, 4:29:37 PM] HengHongLee: ok i know already @⁨Praise⁩
[31/12/24, 4:29:44 PM] HengHongLee: its the rate diff of the LAST step
[31/12/24, 4:29:52 PM] HengHongLee: which is PHP/PHP
[31/12/24, 4:29:56 PM] HengHongLee: -10php for send
[31/12/24, 4:30:00 PM] Praise: Haha, Yea
[31/12/24, 4:30:09 PM] HengHongLee: yeah can you fix that?
[31/12/24, 4:30:20 PM] Praise: Sure
[31/12/24, 4:43:48 PM] Ben Menyala: While you’re at it can you help to export a csv of the 4 txns ample had with the correct rate diff (the preview page)

[31/12/24, 4:47:22 PM] Ben Menyala: Actly ya we need the correct math for the bundle for the 3 txns
[31/12/24, 4:47:37 PM] Ben Menyala: We can update the html if we can get the correct math hahaha
[31/12/24, 4:47:48 PM] Ben Menyala: Screenshot and send to Matt
[31/12/24, 4:51:37 PM] HengHongLee: ((42.7206-(25000/589.59))/ (((25000/589.59) + 42.7206)/2)) * 100 = 0.7477480886
((42.7206-(28,662/675.96))/ (((28,662/675.96) + 42.7206)/2)) * 100 = 0.7487624591

[31/12/24, 4:56:41 PM] HengHongLee: sure
[31/12/24, 4:56:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Like flatten the bundle then they see this
‎[31/12/24, 4:57:45 PM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[31/12/24, 4:59:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Would be good for a report, even better if one more column for bene name can be populated
[31/12/24, 4:59:24 PM] Ben Menyala: Hmmm
[31/12/24, 4:59:37 PM] Ben Menyala: Bene name and sender name is it sth we need to scrape entirely
[31/12/24, 5:00:06 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe they can export as CSV and send to straitsX if we have these info?
[31/12/24, 5:00:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Thinking aloud
‎[31/12/24, 6:35:17 PM] Praise: ‎image omitted

[31/12/24, 6:35:25 PM] Praise: Fixed @⁨Ben Menyala⁩
[31/12/24, 6:36:26 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh wait it’s different from this math?
[31/12/24, 6:38:59 PM] Praise: Hmmm
[31/12/24, 6:41:08 PM] Praise: It’s a weighted average. And this is the correct values
[31/12/24, 6:53:00 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hmmm… 107.30 ? Is this a growing number ? Heh heh … I recall it was 107 when we saw it earlier @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ … 
I maybe remembering it incorrectly
[31/12/24, 6:56:18 PM] Ben Menyala: 100.73 is correct
[31/12/24, 6:56:36 PM] Ben Menyala: Without fees their fx is 100 bucks
[31/12/24, 6:56:45 PM] Ben Menyala: We needed 100.73 to fulfil the pesos
[31/12/24, 6:56:51 PM] Ben Menyala: So actly it’s a losing txn for them
[31/12/24, 6:57:02 PM] Ben Menyala: If they didn’t collect the 5 dollar fee
[31/12/24, 6:57:10 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos it’s a small amt
[31/12/24, 6:57:31 PM] Ben Menyala: For other bigger amts like this 680 one we only took 675.96 from them
[31/12/24, 6:57:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: Got it
[31/12/24, 6:58:22 PM] Sandra Fortune: I saw it as $107 🤣🤣🤣
The dyslexic disease spreads …. Hahahah
[31/12/24, 6:59:44 PM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣
[31/12/24, 7:00:20 PM] Ben Menyala: If it’s 107 matt will slap us
[31/12/24, 7:00:20 PM] Ben Menyala: He took 105 from customer we take 107 from him
[31/12/24, 7:00:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahahahahhahah … money losing business 😬😬😬
[31/12/24, 7:23:42 PM] Ben Menyala: Oh yeah should we remind straitsX
[31/12/24, 7:23:52 PM] Ben Menyala: About the commercial call on Thurs
[31/12/24, 7:24:02 PM] Ben Menyala: Has it been setup
[31/12/24, 7:34:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Can you share your code for this part again haha I think your math is correct @⁨Praise⁩
[31/12/24, 7:55:16 PM] Sandra Fortune: Nope. Not set up yet .. hahah 
We don’t chase - they don’t do anything 🙄
[31/12/24, 7:55:40 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha
[31/12/24, 7:56:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: For this Milind mention he will speak to tian Wei directly.
But I think we should have a base line 

On our end - let’s look at the rates they are giving us now
[31/12/24, 7:56:57 PM] Sandra Fortune: We have a $680 and $100 
I haven’t looked at all the specific rates. 
Let’s pull it out Thur and then we can set up a call (not waiting for them) on 6th Jan  or 7th Jan

‎[1/1/25, 10:05:08 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[1/1/25, 10:05:26 AM] HengHongLee: i dont think my calculation is the wrong one tho
[1/1/25, 10:05:33 AM] HengHongLee: why is it 0.8970%
[1/1/25, 10:06:27 AM] HengHongLee: why would they want to see the sum difference
[1/1/25, 7:29:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hey guys. I’ll be WFH tomorrow.
[2/1/25, 9:22:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: Is the logic we are using this currently this one ?
[2/1/25, 9:23:14 AM] HengHongLee: currently no
[2/1/25, 9:23:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: Which one we using ?
[2/1/25, 9:23:37 AM] HengHongLee: this one
[2/1/25, 9:24:00 AM] HengHongLee: giving this result
[2/1/25, 9:24:15 AM] HengHongLee: but i still think its wrong waiting for praise's answer
[2/1/25, 9:24:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok - are we still trying to challenge it or we will use it ?
[2/1/25, 9:24:43 AM] HengHongLee: lets wait for praise
[2/1/25, 9:24:58 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok
[2/1/25, 9:59:03 AM] Sandra Fortune: Guys … one thing. How do we cater to txn that don’t deduct $5 - Ample’s flat fee ? Eg. My first send was $680 - $680 was sent not $675
Does our system recognise it as $680 or $675. 
Math seems to see it as the latter
[2/1/25, 10:01:17 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha you’re promised the pesos
[2/1/25, 10:01:44 AM] Ben Menyala: The difference between what we deducted in sgd and what ample collected is their profit
[2/1/25, 10:02:00 AM] Ben Menyala: We actually shouldn’t know what ample collected
[2/1/25, 10:04:29 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ah.. ok. So the csv that ample has loaded is $675.96 
Got it.

Eh - then Ample’s math is wrong hahahahhahaha
[2/1/25, 10:05:06 AM] Ben Menyala: No no
[2/1/25, 10:05:10 AM] Ben Menyala: They only load the pesos
[2/1/25, 10:05:18 AM] Ben Menyala: They don’t tell us the sgd amount
[2/1/25, 10:05:25 AM] Ben Menyala: They tell us the pesos the recipient needs to receive
[2/1/25, 10:05:38 AM] Ben Menyala: We calculate how much sgd we will deduct to fulfil that
[2/1/25, 10:06:34 AM] Ben Menyala: So we deduct 675.96 to fulfil that pesos promised to the recipient at the counter
[2/1/25, 10:07:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: So even if there’s a waiver of $5 or not the amount doesn’t change from a sender who is being charged $5 at the end of the day as the impacted party is receiver
[2/1/25, 10:09:43 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha I call you
[2/1/25, 10:09:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Give me 1 min - I take my ear piece
[2/1/25, 10:10:04 AM] Ben Menyala: Can
[2/1/25, 10:10:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok can now
[2/1/25, 1:38:20 PM] Praise: I’m gonna check it again
[2/1/25, 2:04:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Praise⁩ - you are an hour early
[2/1/25, 2:04:38 PM] Sandra Fortune: Kekekeke
[2/1/25, 2:04:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: It’s 2 here in sg - our call is at 3
[2/1/25, 2:05:09 PM] Praise: lool, didn’t notice
[2/1/25, 2:05:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahaha … no worries !
[2/1/25, 2:05:34 PM] Sandra Fortune: Go have your breakfast first
[2/1/25, 2:05:57 PM] Praise: too early for bfast 🙃
[2/1/25, 2:06:20 PM] Sandra Fortune: 7am ?
[2/1/25, 2:06:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: Dude - I’m at the gym at 7am hehehheheh
[2/1/25, 2:07:01 PM] Praise: I’m an evening gym person 😂
[2/1/25, 2:07:38 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahaha …..
[3/1/25, 9:59:51 AM] HengHongLee: made some changes to the jira @⁨Ben Menyala⁩
[3/1/25, 10:15:31 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya I saw thanksss
[3/1/25, 11:29:50 AM] Sandra Fortune: Guys we have a lot of Xweave slack chats hahah
[3/1/25, 11:30:01 AM] Sandra Fortune: Probably have to clean all out and use only 1
[3/1/25, 2:48:53 PM] Praise: Saw them too.
[3/1/25, 3:09:55 PM] Praise: Btw as I was working on the refId thing we discussed yesterday, I just realised that it’s not really advisable to update ids on db. I think it is better to just allow the system to upload the new refId, and we have 2 entries. One successful and the other one failed.
[3/1/25, 3:10:05 PM] Praise: wdyt @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[3/1/25, 3:10:58 PM] HengHongLee: > I just realised that it’s not really advisable to update ids on db

what are the implications here
[3/1/25, 3:14:23 PM] Praise: For example that refId is tied to a particular request, When trying to track back, the refId would be tied to a new entry and not the old one.
[3/1/25, 3:15:06 PM] HengHongLee: yes but we’re not tying anything to the refId, we have our own id's
[3/1/25, 3:15:19 PM] HengHongLee: we’ll never tie anything to the customer’s refId
[3/1/25, 3:16:26 PM] Praise: Hmmm, ICIC
[3/1/25, 3:16:48 PM] HengHongLee: yeah just for indexing
[3/1/25, 3:23:03 PM] Sandra Fortune: Guys - do you see any production txn ?
[3/1/25, 3:23:39 PM] Praise: You mean maybe from ample?
[3/1/25, 3:23:53 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yes. Did they send anything ?
[3/1/25, 3:23:58 PM] Praise: None
[3/1/25, 3:24:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: 😬 @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - can you check with QY/Matt if anything coming thru ?
[3/1/25, 3:25:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: Think he mention he will send -  but not sure. 
He say he need to jaga his audit hahahah
[3/1/25, 3:25:39 PM] Praise: BTW @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ you think maybe you can get list of things to be improved with the bundle flow from Matt? ‎<This message was edited>
[3/1/25, 3:25:49 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha okay I’ll ask them
[3/1/25, 3:25:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh he sent a list
[3/1/25, 3:26:06 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me tidy it up and put in Jira
[3/1/25, 3:26:11 PM] Praise: Yea
[3/1/25, 3:27:20 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ask Matt first then do jira please 😬😬🤣
Hahaha 
Thanks !
[3/1/25, 3:35:05 PM] HengHongLee: they never top up straitsx they cant send
[3/1/25, 3:35:27 PM] HengHongLee: also @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ did we conclude on the customer profile
[3/1/25, 3:35:54 PM] Ben Menyala: We using Ample as the customer profile right
[3/1/25, 3:36:08 PM] HengHongLee: we didnt set any customer profile on the ample straitsx account
[3/1/25, 3:36:36 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh cos they top up directly?
[3/1/25, 3:36:36 PM] HengHongLee: need to call the customer profile api to setup customer profile so that when you use straitsx topup method can select customer profile
[3/1/25, 3:36:42 PM] Ben Menyala: I see
[3/1/25, 3:37:03 PM] HengHongLee: https://docs.straitsx.com/docs/first-party-transfer
[3/1/25, 3:37:36 PM] Ben Menyala: I think the conclusion was we no need cust profile for every customer since ample will be sending the csv to straitsx for compliance purposes
[3/1/25, 3:37:51 PM] HengHongLee: yes but still need a customer profile for ample
[3/1/25, 3:38:19 PM] Ben Menyala: customerName
registrationType (business)
registrationId (UEN)
[3/1/25, 3:38:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Just need this for Ample right based on the docs
[3/1/25, 3:38:34 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[3/1/25, 3:38:37 PM] Ben Menyala: I think we can get these alr
[3/1/25, 3:39:13 PM] HengHongLee: need to build it into the product coz technically i cant get their api key to fire this customer profile creation
[3/1/25, 3:39:37 PM] Ben Menyala: AMPLE TRANSFERS PTE. LTD.
Business
200006309W
[3/1/25, 3:40:09 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh api key doesn’t allow for customer profile creation?
[3/1/25, 3:40:19 PM] HengHongLee: i dont have their api key
[3/1/25, 3:40:27 PM] HengHongLee: its in the secrets vault i shouldnt access
[3/1/25, 3:40:33 PM] Ben Menyala: Or you mean they need to input this into the dashboard
[3/1/25, 3:41:29 PM] Ben Menyala: I see so the web app should ask for these info 

Then we call using the api key in the secrets vault to create the customer profile right ‎<This message was edited>

[3/1/25, 3:43:33 PM] HengHongLee: ok i managed to create it
[3/1/25, 3:43:48 PM] HengHongLee: no
[3/1/25, 3:43:53 PM] HengHongLee: i think that one for swift
[3/1/25, 3:43:58 PM] Ben Menyala: I see okkk
[3/1/25, 3:44:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay ample going to send another 2 txns
[3/1/25, 3:44:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Below 1K
[3/1/25, 3:45:06 PM] HengHongLee: let me know when they topup straitsx and how much
[3/1/25, 3:48:52 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ we’ll probably also need a FAST topup into bundle
[3/1/25, 3:50:32 PM] Praise: Hmmm
[3/1/25, 3:51:11 PM] Praise: So we provide an account they top up to that would trigger the process right?
[3/1/25, 3:51:40 PM] HengHongLee: need to revamp abit of the paynow/fast stuff using the metaworkflow
[3/1/25, 3:51:55 PM] HengHongLee: because right now its like messy in the codebase
[3/1/25, 4:05:03 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ the customer profile will have namecheck so they can only send from that bank account
[3/1/25, 4:05:22 PM] HengHongLee: can u make sure they are topping up from here
[3/1/25, 4:05:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Okk
[3/1/25, 4:13:14 PM] Praise: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ is there no webhook notifications for top up on stx? We can use that to update their balance with us right?
[3/1/25, 4:13:41 PM] HengHongLee: there is
[3/1/25, 4:17:37 PM] HengHongLee: but we dont need that feature. we should just be topup to send
[3/1/25, 4:17:55 PM] HengHongLee: and they should generate the deposit instructions from our app
[3/1/25, 4:19:01 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahhh similar to our single txn flow
[3/1/25, 4:20:39 PM] Praise: No I am talking about this balance thing that we always requore Matt to inform us how much they topped up on stx
[3/1/25, 4:24:09 PM] HengHongLee: they should be able to generate a topup request
[3/1/25, 4:24:17 PM] HengHongLee: anw i dont think straitsx has a deposit webhook
[3/1/25, 4:24:44 PM] HengHongLee: https://docs.straitsx.com/docs/first-party-transfer
‎[3/1/25, 4:28:47 PM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[3/1/25, 4:28:51 PM] HengHongLee: anyway @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ their customer profile thing is setup so they can use the paynow and fast single flows. but right now they cant do a FAST -> Straitsx trigger im gonna add that in
[3/1/25, 4:28:51 PM] Ben Menyala: Reality check is here 😅😅😅
‎[3/1/25, 4:29:04 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted

[3/1/25, 4:46:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya I just calculate from the numbers above
[3/1/25, 4:46:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Compared to midmarket
[3/1/25, 4:55:25 PM] Praise: Damn how all these guys having this good rates
‎[3/1/25, 4:58:09 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[3/1/25, 4:58:14 PM] HengHongLee: our paraswap rates beat all of them
[3/1/25, 4:58:17 PM] HengHongLee: by quite abit
[3/1/25, 4:58:20 PM] Ben Menyala: They buy inventory of pesos
[3/1/25, 4:58:25 PM] Ben Menyala: When it’s low
[3/1/25, 4:58:33 PM] HengHongLee: even including the 15cents topup of straitsx
[3/1/25, 4:58:39 PM] Ben Menyala: It’s really a trading house
[3/1/25, 4:58:52 PM] Ben Menyala: You can do that when you have good treasury ops
[3/1/25, 5:09:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahah it’s the only way for xweave to even have a shot lolol
[3/1/25, 5:09:20 PM] Ben Menyala: Or maybe we really need to go after exotic corridors
[3/1/25, 5:09:33 PM] Ben Menyala: If milind doesn’t have the courage to do defi
[3/1/25, 5:10:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Honestly there’s no rev share model if we squeeze down to 15 bps each for our partner vasps
[3/1/25, 5:10:37 PM] Ben Menyala: And that’s just going to be comparable with competitors ‎<This message was edited>
[3/1/25, 5:23:49 PM] Sandra Fortune: We need to go towards Defi

[3/1/25, 5:26:32 PM] Ben Menyala: 360M annual flow
[3/1/25, 5:26:35 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ehhhh…. Hmmmm….

[3/1/25, 5:26:42 PM] Sandra Fortune: Need to think more than Lulu 😬
[3/1/25, 6:39:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Actly do you mind sharing which one is your most expensive corridor?
[3/1/25, 6:39:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Global USD because we pay swift fees
[3/1/25, 6:39:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha maybe usdc xsgd is a good market

[10/1/25, 6:22:13 PM] HengHongLee: maybe usdc > xsgd can be cheap
[10/1/25, 6:26:16 PM] HengHongLee: actually for paraswap we can also support POL token for swaps then we can do XSGD -> POL -> POL(pdax) -> PHP
[10/1/25, 6:27:08 PM] HengHongLee: USDT pol also can 😂
[10/1/25, 6:29:38 PM] Praise: So we hold position in POL?

[10/1/25, 6:34:08 PM] Ben Menyala: That’s the almond fintech model I think
[10/1/25, 6:34:10 PM] Ben Menyala: They’re doing this
[10/1/25, 6:34:16 PM] Ben Menyala: What’s the rates for this ah
[10/1/25, 6:34:39 PM] Ben Menyala: I think at any one point there’ll be an opportunity for abritrage for one of the coins
[10/1/25, 6:35:04 PM] Ben Menyala: Sorry I mean this one
[10/1/25, 6:35:18 PM] HengHongLee: u need the vasps to also have the asset tho
[10/1/25, 6:35:54 PM] HengHongLee: its inside the link
[10/1/25, 6:36:04 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya that’s why almond fintech only do exchange
[10/1/25, 6:36:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Which has a lot of pairs
[10/1/25, 6:36:15 PM] Ben Menyala: Like independent reserve got all these pairs
[10/1/25, 6:36:19 PM] HengHongLee: what does it mean by do exchange
[10/1/25, 6:36:35 PM] Ben Menyala: Like they use exchanges on both sides
[10/1/25, 6:36:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Not stablecoin issuers who have very limited pairs (like straitsX only do xsgd to usdc)
[10/1/25, 6:37:02 PM] HengHongLee: why would there be an arbitrage if exchanges on both side
[10/1/25, 6:37:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Like sgd to Avax 
Avax to pesos 

Different exchanges might price avax differently
[10/1/25, 6:37:35 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos of supply and demand
[10/1/25, 6:37:46 PM] Ben Menyala: So there’s an arb opportunity
[10/1/25, 6:37:57 PM] Ben Menyala: Esp volatile tokens
[10/1/25, 6:38:13 PM] HengHongLee: not sure abt that but ok
[10/1/25, 6:39:15 PM] Sandra Fortune: His thinking about his kim chi premium model
[10/1/25, 6:39:53 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya Kim Chi premium
[10/1/25, 6:40:15 PM] HengHongLee: i know but thats caused by something structural
[10/1/25, 6:40:23 PM] HengHongLee: like a missing link somewhere
[10/1/25, 6:41:48 PM] Ben Menyala: Like you see sol on all these exchanges
‎[10/1/25, 6:42:00 PM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[10/1/25, 6:42:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Already v different prices
[10/1/25, 6:42:39 PM] HengHongLee: yah but some exchange just have v thin order books
[10/1/25, 6:42:51 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[10/1/25, 6:42:52 PM] HengHongLee: if u try to sell the expensive sol u get rekt with slippage
[10/1/25, 6:43:15 PM] Ben Menyala: Fair need to take into calculation too
[10/1/25, 6:43:52 PM] HengHongLee: i dont think its easy to find high vol and price difference
[10/1/25, 6:44:12 PM] HengHongLee: likely they use the same market maker
[10/1/25, 6:44:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya but if you hit all these token pairs in real time , might be able to find at least one?
[10/1/25, 6:44:44 PM] Ben Menyala: But different exchanges will use different market makers
[10/1/25, 6:44:50 PM] Ben Menyala: Like some same
[10/1/25, 6:44:53 PM] Ben Menyala: But some might be different
[10/1/25, 6:45:21 PM] Ben Menyala: And also exchanges will subsidise some market makers too to provide liquidity because they got to fill the counter trade
[10/1/25, 6:45:38 PM] Ben Menyala: Because the demand for each token is different
[10/1/25, 6:45:41 PM] Ben Menyala: In different exchanges
[10/1/25, 6:47:31 PM] HengHongLee: if market makers are incentivized to make the market for a lesser known exchange the rate will be made closer to the market rate
[10/1/25, 6:49:41 PM] HengHongLee: imo its likely that for any high vol mainstream token, the arbitrage opportunity is not alot since the MM would always be happy to buy the cheaper tokens and able to sell them off somewhere else. the benefit of tokens not needing to move physically globally helps make the market more efficient
[10/1/25, 6:56:24 PM] Ben Menyala: True - then maybe it’s using exotic memes
‎[13/1/25, 10:27:49 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[13/1/25, 10:27:56 AM] HengHongLee: seems like pdax usd -> php quite ex
[13/1/25, 10:29:26 AM] Ben Menyala: Guess a lot of them selling usdc for pesos on pdax
[13/1/25, 10:29:42 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha markets not up
[13/1/25, 10:29:48 AM] HengHongLee: by right shouldnt affect our rates because its a markup
[13/1/25, 10:29:50 AM] Ben Menyala: They offramping
[13/1/25, 10:30:09 AM] HengHongLee: this not defi

[13/1/25, 10:34:26 AM] Sandra Fortune: Why doesn’t it affect. 
It should affect since base rates are moving and the mark up is using those ?
[13/1/25, 10:39:07 AM] HengHongLee: yah
[13/1/25, 10:39:19 AM] HengHongLee: this is the difference of the pdax rates and the market rates ‎<This message was edited>
[13/1/25, 10:40:02 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya I think there’s a lot of inefficiency
[13/1/25, 10:40:15 AM] Ben Menyala: Between fx on exchanges and the realtime mid market fiat fix
[13/1/25, 10:40:24 AM] Ben Menyala: So there’ll be discrepancy
[13/1/25, 10:42:28 AM] HengHongLee: hopefully one day we can work directly with a market maker
[13/1/25, 10:44:01 AM] Ben Menyala: We’ll need license though
[13/1/25, 10:44:13 AM] Ben Menyala: Cos market makers can’t do third party moves
[13/1/25, 10:44:39 AM] HengHongLee: but can they settle to php bank account?
[13/1/25, 10:44:57 AM] HengHongLee: how to sell to php with market maker if cannot settle?
[13/1/25, 10:45:04 AM] Ben Menyala: I think maybe that’s why bridge have a custodial wallet between the 2 VASPs
[13/1/25, 10:45:06 AM] HengHongLee: or any local currency
[13/1/25, 10:45:18 AM] Ben Menyala: And bridge also owns the fiat local currency accounts
[13/1/25, 10:45:23 AM] Sandra Fortune: What do we need to do to get to work with them directly …
[13/1/25, 10:45:35 AM] HengHongLee: we should ask them actually ‎<This message was edited>

[13/1/25, 10:46:59 AM] Ben Menyala: You see this model allows bridge to work with MM directly
[13/1/25, 10:47:01 AM] HengHongLee: > And bridge also owns the fiat local currency accounts 
we can have the local off ramp co. own the local accounts and we send the crypto USDC to the market maker
[13/1/25, 10:47:04 AM] Ben Menyala: Cos it’s still first party
[13/1/25, 10:47:31 AM] Ben Menyala: Co own means we need license though
[13/1/25, 10:47:33 AM] HengHongLee: its still first party coz the USDC leg is crypto
[13/1/25, 10:48:04 AM] HengHongLee: dragonpay (blue) owns the r/s with the market maker
[13/1/25, 10:48:13 AM] HengHongLee: and topup via USDC which is sent by “us” but actually dragonpay first party topup ‎<This message was edited>

[13/1/25, 10:52:00 AM] Ben Menyala: But why will pdax let you do it hahaha
[13/1/25, 10:52:06 AM] Ben Menyala: So means dragon needs their own wallet
[13/1/25, 10:52:18 AM] Ben Menyala: Pdax confirm still wanna earn the fees
[13/1/25, 10:53:20 AM] HengHongLee: market maker probably only work with folks with volume

[13/1/25, 11:16:11 AM] Ben Menyala: No the new txns table
[13/1/25, 11:16:36 AM] Ben Menyala: Basically every txn in the table needs to be one txn for their customers
[13/1/25, 11:17:08 AM] Ben Menyala: Top up lower priority than the txns table fix

[13/1/25, 6:29:31 PM] Ben Menyala: not sure what's the error
[13/1/25, 6:34:36 PM] HengHongLee: not sure but looks like relationship to sender is wrong
[13/1/25, 6:35:18 PM] Praise: Hmm, need to even fix that something went wrong
[13/1/25, 6:35:30 PM] Praise: But let me check exactly why this failed
[13/1/25, 6:36:23 PM] Praise: Row 3 exceeded maximum amount. Max amount is 50000 PHP
[13/1/25, 6:36:59 PM] Praise: Fixing this something went wrong now
[13/1/25, 6:37:24 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohhh my bad added on zero
[13/1/25, 6:37:26 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay thanks
[13/1/25, 6:37:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya hahah
[13/1/25, 6:37:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos the error catching only shows up on the next page too
[13/1/25, 6:48:07 PM] Praise: Ok raising the PR now
[13/1/25, 6:48:16 PM] Ben Menyala: For this are you thinking of having this step in the execute page? Or the page after where we send the bulk order?
[13/1/25, 6:48:34 PM] Praise: On the execute page
[13/1/25, 6:48:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Got it, above the table?
[13/1/25, 6:49:28 PM] Ben Menyala: On the execute page might make more sense come to think of it, cos if quote expires we can force the user to requote
‎[13/1/25, 6:49:31 PM] Praise: ‎image omitted
[13/1/25, 6:50:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh this is the page after
[13/1/25, 6:50:13 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos if the top up takes time
[13/1/25, 6:50:22 PM] Ben Menyala: We can’t force them to requote here though
[13/1/25, 6:50:26 PM] Ben Menyala: We might need to do the page before
[13/1/25, 6:50:27 PM] Praise: Hmm
[13/1/25, 6:50:28 PM] Praise: I see
[13/1/25, 6:50:42 PM] Praise: Ok this is tricky. haha
[13/1/25, 6:51:03 PM] Praise: Because u technically can’t requote once order has been created
[13/1/25, 6:51:09 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha don’t rush this feature first actly
[13/1/25, 6:51:18 PM] Praise: Yes let us discuss more about it
[13/1/25, 6:51:19 PM] Ben Menyala: I’ll send the demo to milind without this
[13/1/25, 6:51:20 PM] Praise: lmao
[13/1/25, 6:51:21 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh haha
[13/1/25, 6:51:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Need to think through properly this one

[13/1/25, 7:12:04 PM] Praise: > Clicking on more than 7 items on a page results in "Something went wrong error"

@⁨Ben Menyala⁩ can explain this?
[13/1/25, 7:12:30 PM] Ben Menyala: On the current platform when I click show more than 7 results in a table it throws the error page
[13/1/25, 7:12:33 PM] Ben Menyala: Not sure why
[13/1/25, 7:12:40 PM] Ben Menyala: Also I think default we should have 10
[13/1/25, 7:12:53 PM] Praise: show what? I am lost, lol
[13/1/25, 7:12:56 PM] Ben Menyala: There’s a request from Ample to have more than 7 rows haha
[13/1/25, 7:13:04 PM] Ben Menyala: The “something went wrong” page
[13/1/25, 7:13:16 PM] Ben Menyala: After I click show more than 7 rows below any table
[13/1/25, 7:13:19 PM] Praise: Oh u mean the list
[13/1/25, 7:13:27 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya the table list
[13/1/25, 7:13:45 PM] Praise: How many rows they want
[13/1/25, 7:14:14 PM] Praise: I’m not experiencing this tho
[13/1/25, 7:14:21 PM] Ben Menyala: That’s weird
[13/1/25, 7:14:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me try to reproduce
[13/1/25, 7:14:36 PM] Praise: But if they want more they can just click the show 50
[13/1/25, 7:14:43 PM] Ben Menyala: Let’s do 10 default
[13/1/25, 7:15:03 PM] Ben Menyala: And then we allow them to show more (like 50) if needed
[13/1/25, 7:15:14 PM] Praise: Yea there’s 50
[13/1/25, 7:15:33 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh let’s change the default to 10
[13/1/25, 7:15:41 PM] Sandra Fortune: 7 to 10 is a small increment
[13/1/25, 7:15:54 PM] Ben Menyala: They can click view more if they want ba
[13/1/25, 7:15:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahah if too long
[13/1/25, 7:16:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Page might load a bit more slowly
[13/1/25, 7:16:17 PM] Sandra Fortune: They don’t want to click right - he want to default
[13/1/25, 7:16:22 PM] Sandra Fortune: True
[13/1/25, 7:16:44 PM] Ben Menyala: I think maybe cos when he clicked then there’s the “something went wrong” error
[13/1/25, 7:16:50 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me try to reproduce
[13/1/25, 7:16:55 PM] Praise: Haha
[13/1/25, 7:17:44 PM] Praise: Ok if can reproduce let me try and fix. I don’t think that default of 10 is needed tbh. It’s just a list 😝
[13/1/25, 7:21:37 PM] Praise: I just experienced it
[13/1/25, 7:21:42 PM] Praise: The something went wrong
[13/1/25, 7:22:14 PM] Praise: It’s the fatal page
[13/1/25, 7:28:55 PM] Ben Menyala: ohhh how did you reproduce
[13/1/25, 7:29:51 PM] Praise: After been idle

[14/1/25, 8:53:53 AM] Ben Menyala: She thought Vanta is the auditor but I told her it’s just a SaaS tool to help us with the cert , we still need a separate auditor
[14/1/25, 8:54:13 AM] Ben Menyala: She just feel getting audited is too early now and big companies might not need iso27001
[14/1/25, 9:02:53 AM] Sandra Fortune: But we need to find out what is effort in terms of tee shirt sizing also.
[14/1/25, 9:02:55 AM] HengHongLee: then she can go ask big company

[14/1/25, 10:51:40 AM] Sandra Fortune: On PDAX side - let’s align how much we want them to shave off and we speak to kit first 
I am sure it will go to Kenneth-Milind-Nish-something.
But we kick start first
[14/1/25, 10:51:41 AM] HengHongLee: i think we still need discuss internally
[14/1/25, 10:51:47 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay can
[14/1/25, 10:52:12 AM] HengHongLee: but wonder if the VIP thing got deadline to apply by
[14/1/25, 10:52:14 AM] HengHongLee: that is good stuff lol

[14/1/25, 10:52:45 AM] Ben Menyala: Say only until Wed
[14/1/25, 10:52:46 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahah
[14/1/25, 10:52:58 AM] Ben Menyala: Sales tactics

[14/1/25, 10:53:56 AM] HengHongLee: no better place to spend investor money
[14/1/25, 10:56:50 AM] HengHongLee: maybe send lina to chat with this sales lady and can ask her all her questions?
[14/1/25, 10:56:57 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha okay
[14/1/25, 10:57:04 AM] Ben Menyala: Let me postpone and set it up
[14/1/25, 10:57:48 AM] Sandra Fortune: Good idea !!!! I think should get her involve as it’s up her alley. 
She’s also aligned to get it sooner then later right
[14/1/25, 10:59:17 AM] Sandra Fortune: I remembered Milind mention something about Lulu doing compliance as a service
[14/1/25, 10:59:35 AM] Sandra Fortune: Is that service construct similar to Vanta ?
[14/1/25, 11:49:49 AM] Ben Menyala: ohh no la that's different
[14/1/25, 11:50:07 AM] Ben Menyala: milind said compliance as a service meaning to tap on lulu's MTL license
[14/1/25, 11:50:08 AM] Ben Menyala: lolol

[15/1/25, 10:12:15 AM] Sandra Fortune: quick send money.
[15/1/25, 10:12:39 AM] Sandra Fortune: oh yes - HengHong did you fund ample transaction on 30th with 1000 USDCmatic?
[15/1/25, 10:12:44 AM] Sandra Fortune: you need to claim back
[15/1/25, 10:12:59 AM] HengHongLee: wasnt 1000usdc
[15/1/25, 10:13:02 AM] HengHongLee: i think i send $5
[15/1/25, 10:13:06 AM] HengHongLee: or less
[15/1/25, 10:14:01 AM] Sandra Fortune: ok. I saw the swap for 1000 usdc to sgd - was thinking whose money 
So the bulk is ample's money, you paid for the move back to SX which is about $5
[15/1/25, 10:14:34 AM] HengHongLee: no leh i didnt do that
[15/1/25, 10:15:17 AM] Sandra Fortune: ok. cool. as long as you didn't need to cough out 1K USDC I am happy
[15/1/25, 10:15:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: hahhaa.
[15/1/25, 10:19:53 AM] Ben Menyala: Guys I’m down with food poisoning haha @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ hope you’re ok
[15/1/25, 10:20:12 AM] HengHongLee: wah what did u all eat
[15/1/25, 10:20:16 AM] Sandra Fortune: 🫢 oh my gosh. yes ! I am ok.
[15/1/25, 10:20:27 AM] Sandra Fortune: hahha - we went to shin minori and eat expensive bento.
[15/1/25, 10:21:09 AM] Sandra Fortune: but I drank wine last night during dinner. maybe that's why - like Yakult hehehhehehehehe
[15/1/25, 10:22:09 AM] Sandra Fortune: i'm wfh today - later go visit my dad in hospital.
[15/1/25, 10:39:02 AM] HengHongLee: ok
[15/1/25, 10:39:07 AM] HengHongLee: pdax api seems to be down
‎[15/1/25, 10:39:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: Xweave API Pricing Agreement.pdf • ‎5 pages ‎document omitted
[15/1/25, 10:54:25 AM] HengHongLee: ooh 20bps is nice
[15/1/25, 10:54:47 AM] HengHongLee: $0.2 plus gas fee is 🧐
[15/1/25, 10:55:13 AM] Sandra Fortune: yeah - I am trying to do a swap now - my page keep going hangin.
[15/1/25, 10:55:46 AM] HengHongLee: coz pdax is down
‎[15/1/25, 10:56:23 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[15/1/25, 10:56:29 AM] HengHongLee: still 0.357%
[15/1/25, 10:56:48 AM] HengHongLee: but our system smart. send it out to paraswap and swap and send back to straitsx
[15/1/25, 10:57:11 AM] Sandra Fortune: ooooh… no wonder.
[15/1/25, 10:57:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cool
‎[15/1/25, 10:59:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[15/1/25, 11:27:29 AM] Sandra Fortune: oh .. the number of txn display change already hahhaah
[15/1/25, 11:43:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: question : why in bundle page - each item has a different FX rate difference ? While in transaction page its displayed as an equal FX rate applied for the same bundle ?
[15/1/25, 11:44:13 AM] Sandra Fortune: 🫢
[15/1/25, 11:44:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: is the one that we are fixing now ?
[15/1/25, 11:48:05 AM] HengHongLee: v good question!
[15/1/25, 11:48:18 AM] HengHongLee: i think the bundle page should just show the one on the transaction page
[15/1/25, 11:48:43 AM] HengHongLee: which is what i said around the math that praise did is not exactly correct
[15/1/25, 11:52:32 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahaha. Ok. 
Yeah - just remove the difference.
From what Ben schooled me - I feel that we should apply same rate across since the genesis of the transaction sent has been using that structure ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/25, 11:52:49 AM] HengHongLee: lolol
[15/1/25, 11:53:27 AM] HengHongLee: ultimately we just need to show what ample cares about
[15/1/25, 11:55:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: True as well. 
Let’s remove the difference in the bundle page - just adds more point of contention if displayed
[15/1/25, 11:59:15 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh yeah …. One more thing. 
I think my memory is failing … 

I don’t recall ample sending txn on 3rd Jan. there are 2
[15/1/25, 12:01:09 PM] Sandra Fortune: And on 31st I thought there were 3 txn - now it’s only 1 

Did the 2 txn on 31st slide into 3rd somehow ? ‎<This message was edited>
[15/1/25, 12:01:33 PM] HengHongLee: hmm let me check coz that one i did manually
[15/1/25, 12:02:07 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok cool. Let me know
‎[15/1/25, 1:35:46 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[15/1/25, 1:35:58 PM] HengHongLee: but its not in a bundle since the bundle failed and we processed each one individually
[15/1/25, 1:36:13 PM] HengHongLee: let me see if i can just merge it manually
[15/1/25, 1:36:40 PM] Sandra Fortune: Actually it’s ok. We can leave it as individual.
[15/1/25, 1:37:55 PM] Sandra Fortune: I just want to make sure that my memory of tracking them correctly 
So it suppose to be part of 31st txn ?
[15/1/25, 2:38:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: wait.. these 4 are on 30th Dec.
[15/1/25, 2:39:12 PM] HengHongLee: 31st ones are the clean ones
[15/1/25, 2:39:28 PM] Sandra Fortune: i am seeing only 1 on 31st - base on the timestamp.
[15/1/25, 2:39:50 PM] HengHongLee: there was only 1 on the 31st
[15/1/25, 2:39:51 PM] Sandra Fortune: 2 others on 3rd. I am wondering if the 2 others with Date stamp : 3rd belongs to 31st.
[15/1/25, 2:40:00 PM] Sandra Fortune: oh. i thought there wer e3.
[15/1/25, 2:40:20 PM] Sandra Fortune: i saw there was 1 $100plus and another 2 other txn.
‎[15/1/25, 2:40:49 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[15/1/25, 2:40:52 PM] HengHongLee: u should be seeing this
[15/1/25, 2:41:26 PM] HengHongLee: u can search for refId RE2412310001
‎[15/1/25, 2:41:35 PM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[15/1/25, 2:42:25 PM] HengHongLee: dont click into it. the numbers inside are for the bundle
[15/1/25, 2:42:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: yes - this one is timestamp on 31st.
[15/1/25, 2:45:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: Refid : TP2501030029 and TA2501030004 are on 3rd which are in 1 bundle. 
Didn't know that there were txn on 3rd
[15/1/25, 2:45:14 PM] HengHongLee: yes there was
[15/1/25, 2:45:53 PM] Sandra Fortune: ok. got it.
[15/1/25, 2:46:07 PM] Sandra Fortune: i keep thinking we have sent a total of 3 txn on 31st instead of 1.
[15/1/25, 3:25:07 PM] Praise: Ah so preferably all difference should be same right?
[15/1/25, 3:25:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah. So we don’t apply weightage to it ( in the sense of larger amount gaining better bps)
[15/1/25, 3:25:49 PM] Sandra Fortune: So it’s all equal
[15/1/25, 3:27:01 PM] HengHongLee: yeah we can probably remove the rate diff in the bundle page
‎[16/1/25, 7:57:30 AM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[16/1/25, 7:57:53 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - can help set up that time with that Temasek lady on a session to share about Bridge  ?
[16/1/25, 7:58:32 AM] HengHongLee: haha im hearing triple A a few times this week
[16/1/25, 7:59:03 AM] HengHongLee: i hear to topup grab wallet 50sgd need 51 sgd worth of stablecoins
[16/1/25, 7:59:09 AM] HengHongLee: 2% fee
[16/1/25, 7:59:36 AM] Sandra Fortune: Wow. That’s more on high side I assume
[16/1/25, 7:59:47 AM] HengHongLee: yah thats crazy
[16/1/25, 7:59:56 AM] HengHongLee: take 2% from the customer side
[16/1/25, 8:00:02 AM] Sandra Fortune: Usual txn is only 1.8%
[16/1/25, 8:00:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: How to sustain ? Will you if you are a user ? 
For fiat side - no one will want to use the wallet if they were to charge for top up
[16/1/25, 8:00:44 AM] HengHongLee: is topup, so abit lame
[16/1/25, 8:00:55 AM] HengHongLee: i will never use it lo
[16/1/25, 8:00:57 AM] Sandra Fortune: That’s why Straits X charge us 20cents for gas
[16/1/25, 8:01:08 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yalor I wouldn’t also
[16/1/25, 8:03:08 AM] HengHongLee: but this just exchange spread
[16/1/25, 8:03:12 AM] HengHongLee: if topup xsgd ok

[16/1/25, 8:05:24 AM] HengHongLee: i want to see how fast is the deposit
[16/1/25, 8:05:30 AM] HengHongLee: maybe can do back to back
[16/1/25, 8:05:44 AM] HengHongLee: swap -> deposit -> pay
[16/1/25, 8:06:02 AM] HengHongLee: all in once at the point of payment
[16/1/25, 8:06:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: Most likely it’s immediate .. I think 
This one must ask Straits X - they supporting grab with this ability
[16/1/25, 8:06:13 AM] Sandra Fortune: You go ask your intel inside
[16/1/25, 8:06:39 AM] HengHongLee: haha grab as merchant acquirer for me

[16/1/25, 9:44:20 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh I think I lost a few kilos 🥲 Don’t think I can make it to office today, hopefully by tmr I’ll be fine
[16/1/25, 9:44:28 AM] Ben Menyala: My wife was right to avoid raw jap food all along

[17/1/25, 3:52:42 PM] Praise: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ You extended expiry in the FE, but the Execution still uses old expiry?
[17/1/25, 4:23:02 PM] HengHongLee: nah milind’s issue was actually coz pdax’s query took a long time
[17/1/25, 4:23:08 PM] HengHongLee: and we started the count when we create the order
[17/1/25, 4:23:32 PM] HengHongLee: so the order created -> when the UI rendered took too long because pdax was taking a long time for their api
[17/1/25, 4:31:03 PM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ you wanna join scrut automation call ‎<This message was edited>

‎[17/1/25, 5:41:14 PM] Praise: ‎image omitted
[17/1/25, 5:50:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Yup makes sense
[17/1/25, 5:50:39 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe need to prettify this into text haha
[17/1/25, 5:50:49 PM] Ben Menyala: Paynow has extra cost, do we need to factor in
[17/1/25, 5:51:39 PM] Praise: Depends on if they turn it on
[17/1/25, 5:51:42 PM] Praise: It’s by choice
[17/1/25, 5:52:21 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos I think paynow is an extra 50 or 80 cents sgd
[17/1/25, 5:52:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: It’s 80cents
[17/1/25, 5:52:48 PM] Ben Menyala: So instead of say transferring $1500.15 they transfer $1500.80
[17/1/25, 5:53:10 PM] Praise: Yea it’s considwered in the calculation
[17/1/25, 5:53:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Does straitsX automatically ask for the extra
[17/1/25, 5:53:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay nice
[17/1/25, 5:53:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - the rates that straits X sent. Seems to be ok. Let me know what you think.

[17/1/25, 10:33:33 PM] Praise: Yes I definitely need this juicy gist 😂
[18/1/25, 10:48:54 AM] HengHongLee: i just remembered, before i forget, i think we need to set the rates on straitsx for using paynow QR code.  its now $0.85 per use which is expensive
[18/1/25, 10:57:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - I saw it yesterday…
[18/1/25, 11:25:52 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh thought praise said it’s inside the calculation
[18/1/25, 11:31:12 AM] HengHongLee: yes but we are doing the calculation so its not relevant right
[18/1/25, 11:31:48 AM] HengHongLee: anyway when u topup $20 u recv $19.15
[18/1/25, 11:44:44 AM] Ben Menyala: I see we don’t ask for different amounts of top up if it’s paynow right
[18/1/25, 11:44:59 AM] Ben Menyala: So eg if we need 20 dollars to send
[18/1/25, 11:45:03 AM] HengHongLee: yes if fixed dest
[18/1/25, 11:45:05 AM] Ben Menyala: We ask for 20.85

Xweave agrees to cover a portion of the cost for cross-border money transfers, up to a total of USD $1,000, to ensure that the fees for such transfers remain comparable to leading providers in the market. The adjustment will be calculated post-transaction, and the total amount will be credited to the client’s account at the end of the month. ‎<This message was edited>

[23/1/25, 3:00:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩

Think what we can do is share the rates and draft of the addendum to ample first 
Are we ok with the draft addendum ? If not we can send the table first 

Will need to raise the topic of lowering rates with PDAX on the basis that we are subsidising cost now and we are not even getting a fee ‎<This message was edited>
[23/1/25, 3:01:29 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’ll raise it to QM’s side

[23/1/25, 5:23:51 PM] Ben Menyala: they just shared that it's wholesale rates, didn't really share that
[23/1/25, 6:18:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oooh. If wholesale should be mid market but not mid market leh
[23/1/25, 6:19:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahhaa ya their “wholesale” rates definition is just probably “not retail” rates

[7/2/25, 9:13:36 AM] Sandra Fortune: This may be something that Milind was talking to Nichel about that time about ample having an account but not owning the account

[20/2/25, 7:02:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: It’s Mbank who will not allow
[20/2/25, 7:03:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: That’s why I ask. Then someone say yes and another say no
[20/2/25, 7:03:15 PM] HengHongLee: yup
[20/2/25, 7:03:24 PM] HengHongLee: coz they make it so
[20/2/25, 7:03:38 PM] HengHongLee: so if they willing to open up for pdax maybe can
[20/2/25, 7:03:50 PM] HengHongLee: but even then pdax might not want to clear it
[20/2/25, 7:04:08 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah . It’s a prod/biz rule -  not tech constraint…. They muddy the waters themselves

[20/2/25, 7:10:05 PM] Ben Menyala: 🫠
[20/2/25, 7:10:16 PM] HengHongLee: anyway this is the same problem we will have with milind’s favourite CBDCs
[20/2/25, 7:10:21 PM] HengHongLee: 🤣
[20/2/25, 7:10:27 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya sia
[20/2/25, 7:10:42 PM] Ben Menyala: He needs to be on this call
[20/2/25, 7:10:57 PM] Ben Menyala: So he can fully understand the restrictions
[20/2/25, 7:11:41 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhahaha

[20/2/25, 11:24:37 PM] Praise: Not directly tho
[20/2/25, 11:24:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha okk
[20/2/25, 11:26:06 PM] Praise: Yea, I know him as a pretty outgoing person. I think he can be a good fit. But I don’t know his product skills
[20/2/25, 11:26:19 PM] Praise: People liked him alot
[20/2/25, 11:28:04 PM] Ben Menyala: Nicee!! Okay will talk to him haha
[21/2/25, 12:56:16 PM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ anything you wanna update in our api doc to grab
[21/2/25, 12:56:35 PM] Ben Menyala: I think we can send them first but haha if they wanna do P2M we probably will need to build and change the docs up
[21/2/25, 12:56:46 PM] Ben Menyala: Lolol
[21/2/25, 12:58:14 PM] Ben Menyala: Will send the ppt we sent prev to them  too I guess ‎<This message was edited>
[21/2/25, 12:58:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: They shouldn’t do P2M now.  These guys 
Can imagine them at buffet - just eat EVERYTHING and later get indigestion 
Zero self control
[21/2/25, 12:58:45 PM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[21/2/25, 12:59:07 PM] Ben Menyala: So should I just send the api docs
[21/2/25, 12:59:23 PM] Ben Menyala: Without the p2m use case
[21/2/25, 12:59:29 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha really got no context
[21/2/25, 12:59:49 PM] Ben Menyala: I think they’ll read the api docs and will be like whuttt
[21/2/25, 1:00:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: What did that milind ask for . Let me go read again
[21/2/25, 1:00:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Lmaoooo
[21/2/25, 1:00:58 PM] Ben Menyala: No context
[21/2/25, 1:01:01 PM] Ben Menyala: Just say send api docs
[21/2/25, 1:01:55 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ya. 
Think we just send their in app merchants first 
No need to call that out
[21/2/25, 1:02:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: Since the last we spoke to wen bing is on txn in app on their SVF
[21/2/25, 1:02:51 PM] Sandra Fortune: We told them not to go into P2M - merchants that are out of app 
So we should continue that stance
[21/2/25, 1:03:04 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya P2GM
[21/2/25, 1:03:17 PM] Ben Menyala: I mean peer to grab merchants
[21/2/25, 1:03:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay can
[21/2/25, 1:03:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: Once it go scan and make payment all hell may broke loose 
It’s fat but saturated fat
Oh man - need to send HH there to educate them
[21/2/25, 1:03:49 PM] Ben Menyala: I’ll just email ba
[21/2/25, 1:03:59 PM] Ben Menyala: The api docs plus our previous deck
[21/2/25, 1:04:05 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - sounds good
[21/2/25, 1:06:13 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe we need a demo account for grab
[21/2/25, 1:06:18 PM] Ben Menyala: To play around
[21/2/25, 1:07:02 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yes. That will be good 
Especially now it seems that Wenbin may have preliminary thumbs up from his stakeholders to test this with his eng team ‎<This message was edited>
[21/2/25, 1:07:38 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahah yeahh but they got no api keys
[21/2/25, 1:07:42 PM] Ben Menyala: To put in
[21/2/25, 1:07:50 PM] Ben Menyala: So we need our test sandbox first
[21/2/25, 1:07:57 PM] Ben Menyala: HH and praise working on that now
[21/2/25, 1:08:18 PM] Ben Menyala: It’s okay I’ll send them the api docs and the pdf first
[21/2/25, 1:08:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. If not ready yet - it’s ok. But at least we are starting on it. Once it’s available we can share it
[21/2/25, 1:09:04 PM] Ben Menyala: Yupp can
[21/2/25, 1:11:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: Probably we can do a gauge on what is needed and when can the sandbox will be ready 
Im more interested in how it will look like and what we need
[21/2/25, 1:12:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha ya true let’s wait for @⁨HengHongLee⁩ before I send that email then

[21/2/25, 1:13:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: Actually me too. We are thinking of that as a possibility
[21/2/25, 1:13:43 PM] HengHongLee: maybe caveat it with needs some updates to the response

[24/2/25, 10:07:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: Been overused !
[24/2/25, 10:08:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ - I’m going to hide in corners today. Can find me there when you arrive
[24/2/25, 10:11:43 AM] Ben Menyala: LOL I think cos it’s past 3 years already
[24/2/25, 10:12:04 AM] Ben Menyala: My Xiaomi tv is now 3 years 4 months old then it auto break down after warranty period has passed
[24/2/25, 10:12:29 AM] HengHongLee: makes sense
[24/2/25, 10:12:34 AM] HengHongLee: 😂😂
[24/2/25, 10:13:37 AM] HengHongLee: next thing u start seeing is xiaomi ads and some discounts
[24/2/25, 10:14:53 AM] Ben Menyala: LOL damm
[24/2/25, 10:15:11 AM] Ben Menyala: they see their stock rising, just turn on the toggle to destroy all the >3 year old xiaomi tvs
[24/2/25, 10:15:20 AM] Ben Menyala: so revenue figure can go up just in time for next earnings report
[24/2/25, 10:17:29 AM] HengHongLee: u tot freehold but actually is lease only
[24/2/25, 10:17:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahah …. Oh Man. Shelf life 3plus years …. 
Like Apple phones - juice is designed to run out fast
[24/2/25, 10:17:36 AM] Ben Menyala: LOLLLLLL!!!
[24/2/25, 10:17:52 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hanhahahaha
[24/2/25, 10:18:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: Actually if you don’t use stay till run out date - freehold may not make sense. 
And these days - seems like 99 seems to have larger quantum then freehold 
Seems is keyword
[24/2/25, 10:21:08 AM] HengHongLee: people dont care if its 95 or 90years but they care when its 70 vs 40 for example
[24/2/25, 10:21:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: True for apartments.
[24/2/25, 10:22:12 AM] Sandra Fortune: But then again - buying a 40 year left landed is also not wise
[24/2/25, 10:22:17 AM] HengHongLee: i think for housing freehold just enables u to hold out for a buyer
[24/2/25, 10:22:54 AM] HengHongLee: can discuss more i was having this analysis chat with my housing agent friend some months ago
[24/2/25, 10:23:12 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ u want to lunch later?

[25/2/25, 5:29:47 PM] Praise: I think it’s the recipient that didn’t handle it well
[25/2/25, 5:30:02 PM] Praise: They shouldn’t have credited me

[25/2/25, 5:32:29 PM] HengHongLee: wait ah let me check my node

[25/2/25, 5:34:36 PM] Praise: Oh shit
[25/2/25, 5:34:43 PM] HengHongLee: haha ill take a look at it later
[25/2/25, 5:34:46 PM] Ben Menyala: omg let’s drain HH
[25/2/25, 5:34:54 PM] HengHongLee: LOL
[25/2/25, 5:34:57 PM] Praise: Haha
[25/2/25, 5:35:06 PM] HengHongLee: only praise can coz he actually used it
[25/2/25, 5:35:20 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ must use lightning then can drain
[25/2/25, 5:37:17 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩  - start finding ways to do it  !
[25/2/25, 5:37:32 PM] Praise: Tho I’m trying to understand. Are we all sharing same balance on tempest?
[25/2/25, 5:37:39 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[25/2/25, 5:37:41 PM] HengHongLee: haha
[25/2/25, 5:37:43 PM] Praise: Oh
[25/2/25, 5:38:17 PM] HengHongLee: ‎You deleted this message.
[25/2/25, 5:38:22 PM] HengHongLee: lolol
[25/2/25, 5:38:33 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaaha
[25/2/25, 5:39:03 PM] HengHongLee: i know whats the issue alread
[25/2/25, 5:39:06 PM] HengHongLee: its a race condition
[25/2/25, 5:39:25 PM] Praise: But I didn’t send the second one immediately tho?
[25/2/25, 5:39:33 PM] Praise: It was after it failed
[25/2/25, 5:40:16 PM] HengHongLee: it only “failed” on tempest. with “invoice already paid"
[25/2/25, 5:40:26 PM] HengHongLee: so actually its not a fail. it means it was paid
[25/2/25, 5:40:31 PM] Praise: I see
[25/2/25, 5:40:59 PM] HengHongLee: “invoice already paid” errors should always be marked `success`
[25/2/25, 5:44:13 PM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ said he going to give you A+ for performance review for stealing his money @⁨Praise⁩
[25/2/25, 5:44:29 PM] Praise: Haha
[25/2/25, 5:44:33 PM] Praise: I love that
[26/2/25, 9:05:24 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ the csv download works now can you help test it
[26/2/25, 9:30:44 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok cool 
I’ll test in a bit
I think I. Caught some thing in office.
A little fever and sleeping it off 
Not coming in
[26/2/25, 9:39:30 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh dear get well soon Sandra!!
[26/2/25, 9:39:33 AM] Ben Menyala: Will stay at home then too
[26/2/25, 9:39:46 AM] Ben Menyala: Kast numbers look so good
[26/2/25, 9:41:56 AM] HengHongLee: haha seems like a bubble
[26/2/25, 9:42:27 AM] HengHongLee: i have so many random cards
[26/2/25, 9:46:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhahaha ….. is the number base on active cards or cards issued
[26/2/25, 9:47:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oooh active
[26/2/25, 9:47:29 AM] Ben Menyala: But revenue 50m is quite good
[26/2/25, 9:47:49 AM] Ben Menyala: Maybe small for cards business but great for a startup
[26/2/25, 9:48:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok la - 20k active users.
[26/2/25, 9:48:16 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha just like how aspire and velopay told us all their money come from cards hahahah
[26/2/25, 9:48:22 AM] HengHongLee: so their revenue is by card usage?
[26/2/25, 9:48:23 AM] Ben Menyala: They probably took a slice
[26/2/25, 9:48:30 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh I think it’s the fx fees
[26/2/25, 9:48:34 AM] Ben Menyala: Mostly
[26/2/25, 9:48:38 AM] HengHongLee: ah ok
[26/2/25, 9:48:46 AM] HengHongLee: its kind of like youtrip i guess
[26/2/25, 9:48:51 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahhh
[26/2/25, 9:49:16 AM] Sandra Fortune: Probably their eyes on the gross revenue column , not on revenue 
Like 42++ vs 0.7+ 🤣🤣🤣
[26/2/25, 9:49:37 AM] Sandra Fortune: Wonder what YouTrip numbers are
[26/2/25, 9:49:40 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha
[26/2/25, 9:50:33 AM] Sandra Fortune: But for cards toted as crossborder - yeah - they make the overseas fee and fx 
If they want to be competitive - they remove overseas fee
[26/2/25, 9:50:39 AM] Ben Menyala: It says net revenue though not sure hahaha
[26/2/25, 9:57:48 AM] Sandra Fortune: They mention crypto native users makes up a large base 
So the main CVP is the ability to save and use crypto. Unlike traditional cards - where the main purpose is best savings.
So it’s quite different on how the portfolio is run 
So if the CVP is the former - then the need to be lowest in the market is no longer primary
[26/2/25, 9:58:11 AM] HengHongLee: i nvr heard of them as a crypto native
[26/2/25, 9:58:39 AM] HengHongLee: oh its some stablecoin thing
[26/2/25, 9:58:42 AM] Sandra Fortune: So on the contrary of the challengers trad card business face - it may not apply to them
[26/2/25, 9:58:43 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahhh
[26/2/25, 9:59:02 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha ya I think basically those with usdc wanna spend and get 5-12% cashback
[26/2/25, 9:59:07 AM] Sandra Fortune: They are la - they allow holding and burning thru the card… isn’t that what KaST is ?
[26/2/25, 9:59:20 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yes !
[26/2/25, 9:59:24 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya hahaha but in heng hong eyes those are not crypto native
[26/2/25, 9:59:31 AM] Ben Menyala: Those are crypto amateurs
[26/2/25, 9:59:32 AM] HengHongLee: 5-12% cashback is quite good
[26/2/25, 9:59:40 AM] Sandra Fortune: So that’s why in this case - you see their nett rev being higher then typical card business
[26/2/25, 9:59:52 AM] Sandra Fortune: It is . Usually it’s only 8% on avg
[26/2/25, 9:59:56 AM] HengHongLee: numbers seem fishy tho
[26/2/25, 10:00:02 AM] Sandra Fortune: Anything more will be burning their own cash
[26/2/25, 10:00:13 AM] Sandra Fortune: I am sure it’s numbers used for investors ……….
[26/2/25, 10:00:20 AM] HengHongLee: 8% avg? i tot its like smaller like 1-3%
‎[26/2/25, 10:01:07 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[26/2/25, 10:01:13 AM] HengHongLee: ah ok this the pleb card
[26/2/25, 10:01:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: I use to push my banks for 8% on some programs . Rare.
[26/2/25, 10:01:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: It’s their rewards program or cash back
[26/2/25, 10:01:58 AM] HengHongLee: ahhh yes
[26/2/25, 10:02:01 AM] HengHongLee: its points
[26/2/25, 10:02:05 AM] HengHongLee: chey
[26/2/25, 10:02:16 AM] Sandra Fortune: Card fees ! 
See… for folks that want to use their digital assets
[26/2/25, 10:02:31 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahahah - else - no one will want to use 
Kekekeke
[26/2/25, 10:02:33 AM] HengHongLee: nah if i want to use my digital asset i can use basedapp card
[26/2/25, 10:02:49 AM] HengHongLee: free no subscription
[26/2/25, 10:02:53 AM] HengHongLee: even card also free
[26/2/25, 10:03:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah …. Basedapp only in SG ?
[26/2/25, 10:03:29 AM] HengHongLee: for now yes
[26/2/25, 10:03:48 AM] HengHongLee: https://app.basedapp.io?access=DNTBTNY3
[26/2/25, 10:03:53 AM] HengHongLee: haha my referral code
[26/2/25, 10:03:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - I guess that much. That’s why they can’t compare to KaST. Larger team, larger markets
[26/2/25, 10:04:27 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhaha … cool and you only pay when you get the physical card. If I recall correctly
[26/2/25, 10:04:39 AM] HengHongLee: nope got virtual card too
[26/2/25, 10:04:46 AM] HengHongLee: nowadays i dont really want the physical
[26/2/25, 10:05:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - for spends virtual is enough
[26/2/25, 10:05:39 AM] HengHongLee: this reddotpay need $10 for VIRTUAL card lol
‎[26/2/25, 10:05:50 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[26/2/25, 10:05:56 AM] Sandra Fortune: But for reward programs inbuild into the card - it’s dumb - need physical card
[26/2/25, 10:06:06 AM] HengHongLee: why need physical card
[26/2/25, 10:06:11 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh my gawd ! No way I pay for a card hahhaha
[26/2/25, 10:06:33 AM] HengHongLee: 100 usd for physical card
[26/2/25, 10:06:52 AM] HengHongLee: its a bubble
[26/2/25, 10:07:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cos the reward system requires data from the chip and tokenized data doesn’t capture 
I notice some cards are like that
[26/2/25, 10:07:07 AM] Sandra Fortune: Quite inefficient and Lou’s
[26/2/25, 10:07:09 AM] Sandra Fortune: Lousy
[26/2/25, 10:07:14 AM] HengHongLee: eeyer
[26/2/25, 10:08:31 AM] Sandra Fortune: IKR. I am guessing it’s because of how the scheme tokenize format as well. 
But I need to verify in with my visa guys … have never bothered to ask until now - cos curious hahhaha
[26/2/25, 10:08:58 AM] Sandra Fortune: Set up business on cards guys ? 
My first love hahhahaha
[26/2/25, 10:09:11 AM] HengHongLee: i think it makes sense but its kind of stupid from a tech perspective
[26/2/25, 10:09:19 AM] HengHongLee: i think for security makes sense
[26/2/25, 10:09:38 AM] HengHongLee: but for restricting rewards is just being sneaky
[26/2/25, 10:09:42 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhaha … scheme tech is arcade
[26/2/25, 10:10:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah. That’s what I think so as well
[26/2/25, 10:10:58 AM] HengHongLee: https://x.com/solana/status/1894390281799405637?s=46&t=3XvJIiCU4iEOilt9mfXk1A
[26/2/25, 10:11:08 AM] HengHongLee: paxos is on solana. time to see if got free money to yield farm
[26/2/25, 10:11:09 AM] Sandra Fortune: But traditionally reward programs are never govt by the schemes due to their inability to do so
[26/2/25, 10:11:59 AM] HengHongLee: “ChainCatcher news, the stablecoin USDG has announced that it is now available on the Solana blockchain to expand accessibility and usability, while USDG also disclosed new partners such as alfred, Caliza, Noah, Rain, and Sling Money.”
[26/2/25, 10:26:51 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ why is there no card focused on privacy
[26/2/25, 10:27:25 AM] HengHongLee: visa sells the payment info always? any exceptions?
[26/2/25, 10:39:03 AM] Sandra Fortune: Don’t think there will be. Because it’s a vehicle to burn funds 
Privacy side is a side business in the payments world
[26/2/25, 10:39:44 AM] Sandra Fortune: Visa doesn’t and not allowed to. 
And we have strict PDPA policies for staff who handles this kind of data ‎<This message was edited>
[26/2/25, 10:40:05 AM] HengHongLee: who sells the data then
[26/2/25, 10:40:15 AM] HengHongLee: it's definitely sold haha
[26/2/25, 10:40:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: The banks but they can’t ….
[26/2/25, 10:40:35 AM] HengHongLee: or the POS
[26/2/25, 10:40:57 AM] Sandra Fortune: So banks have the clause for collection and usage of data
[26/2/25, 10:41:44 AM] Sandra Fortune: POS will be the acquirers but they are government by it and they are processing the data and don’t keep. 
Only acquirers keep or merchants ‎<This message was edited>
[26/2/25, 10:43:04 AM] HengHongLee: must be merchants
[26/2/25, 10:43:37 AM] HengHongLee: how come giving private info to the merchants
[26/2/25, 10:44:11 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cos rewards program hehe heh
[26/2/25, 10:44:35 AM] HengHongLee: 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
[26/2/25, 10:45:02 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhahahajja … cos of greed - ppl give out their info and then get monetised
[26/2/25, 11:06:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: The KAST dude gave boss the cold shoulder the last time
[26/2/25, 11:06:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hehe ..

[27/2/25, 10:03:34 AM] Ben Menyala: It’ll still hit the 50k php limit though
[27/2/25, 10:04:04 AM] HengHongLee: the limit should be 50,010 instead of 50,000 coz 10php for pdax
[27/2/25, 10:04:23 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohhh lol
[27/2/25, 10:04:37 AM] HengHongLee: ben u should delete ur last message

[27/2/25, 10:21:53 AM] Ben Menyala: Wait Sandra it’s 50k

[27/2/25, 10:22:06 AM] HengHongLee: yes im just retrying that 50k one that failed. ill split it into 2 again
[27/2/25, 10:22:19 AM] HengHongLee: so that 51k one now going to have 3
[27/2/25, 10:22:31 AM] Sandra Fortune: was referring to the limits …

[27/2/25, 10:23:39 AM] HengHongLee: cost another 10php which is ok since they have it in their pdax
[27/2/25, 10:23:40 AM] Sandra Fortune: I've edited to tell him - limit is >= 50k - that's why got caught
[27/2/25, 10:23:45 AM] Ben Menyala: We just tell him when we done
[27/2/25, 10:23:48 AM] Ben Menyala: Okayy nice
[27/2/25, 10:23:49 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahahha

[27/2/25, 10:24:27 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha ok
[27/2/25, 10:24:33 AM] Sandra Fortune: i'm working at a coffee shop at raffles place ! hahaha - needed to get connected.
[27/2/25, 10:24:52 AM] Ben Menyala: Weird we need to split it like that , so once it’s 50k there’ll be RFI?
[27/2/25, 10:24:58 AM] HengHongLee: yes
‎[27/2/25, 10:25:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[27/2/25, 10:25:05 AM] HengHongLee: u can try it on the swap page
[27/2/25, 10:25:11 AM] Ben Menyala: And 49k there isn’t?
[27/2/25, 10:25:12 AM] HengHongLee: once >50k it will ask u for more kyc
[27/2/25, 10:25:18 AM] HengHongLee: 3 options
[27/2/25, 10:25:26 AM] Sandra Fortune: ample never send more than 50k ?
[27/2/25, 10:25:40 AM] HengHongLee: the pdax jokers taking 10php
[27/2/25, 10:25:46 AM] HengHongLee: so became 50010
[27/2/25, 10:25:52 AM] HengHongLee: which is >50k
[27/2/25, 10:26:01 AM] HengHongLee: they counted pre-fees
[27/2/25, 10:26:08 AM] Ben Menyala: Lmaoo
[27/2/25, 10:26:34 AM] Ben Menyala: So actually our limit should be 49990
[27/2/25, 10:26:37 AM] HengHongLee: yes
[27/2/25, 10:26:51 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay makes sense we catch that in the frontend
[27/2/25, 10:26:56 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha
[27/2/25, 10:27:07 AM] Sandra Fortune: thought they should count post fees.
[27/2/25, 10:27:33 AM] HengHongLee: 🤷‍♀️
[27/2/25, 10:27:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: grrrr…
[27/2/25, 10:28:44 AM] HengHongLee: but we could have put in the RFI, we already have the info in the KYC that they send coz they asking for sender address (option 1)

but anyway let me complete the manual transaction first
[27/2/25, 10:29:00 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay can we discuss more later
‎[27/2/25, 10:29:24 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[27/2/25, 10:33:15 AM] Ben Menyala: Oh got it
[27/2/25, 10:33:30 AM] Ben Menyala: So actually we can just handle it on our own in our code when we get the rfi request right
[27/2/25, 10:33:44 AM] HengHongLee: kind of
[27/2/25, 10:33:49 AM] HengHongLee: but i dont know
[27/2/25, 10:33:56 AM] Sandra Fortune: what are the additional RFI
[27/2/25, 10:33:56 AM] HengHongLee: need praise to confirm
[27/2/25, 10:34:14 AM] HengHongLee: these 3 options
[27/2/25, 10:41:09 AM] HengHongLee: ok need to debug this some more
[27/2/25, 10:41:28 AM] Ben Menyala: Ok
[27/2/25, 10:57:14 AM] Ben Menyala: When we split into the two txns there’s still an error?
[27/2/25, 10:57:24 AM] HengHongLee: yes coz theres a bug
[27/2/25, 10:57:55 AM] Ben Menyala: I see okay the fix found?

[27/2/25, 11:54:25 AM] HengHongLee: anyway @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ praise needs a work week heads up if we plan to have him in UAE with me
[27/2/25, 11:54:30 AM] HengHongLee: coz apply visa
[27/2/25, 11:54:45 AM] HengHongLee: so if need me in UAE, id like to have praise there
[27/2/25, 11:54:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok can. I’ll keep Lina updated on this
[27/2/25, 11:54:53 AM] HengHongLee: thank youu!
[27/2/25, 11:55:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oorrrr… yes sir !
[27/2/25, 11:55:03 AM] Ben Menyala: 🚀🚀🚀
[27/2/25, 1:39:39 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ do you have the limits for QY
[27/2/25, 1:41:17 PM] HengHongLee: https://doc.general.api.pdax.ph/#post-fiat-out
[27/2/25, 1:41:34 PM] HengHongLee: docs are here but they dont say which channel it goes on if >50k and we havent tested it yet
[27/2/25, 1:45:37 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh true let me double check with kit he told this last time to us 

Instapay is Php50k per transaction but instant. Pesonet is Php10M per transaction but same day to next day service.
[27/2/25, 1:46:08 PM] Ben Menyala: I’ll confirm with him if the routing is automatically done by them if goes above the 50m threshold
[27/2/25, 2:36:04 PM] Praise: Hi guys. How’s it going?
[27/2/25, 2:36:33 PM] HengHongLee: yo
[27/2/25, 2:36:34 PM] Sandra Fortune: Praise woke up to a million texts
[27/2/25, 2:36:35 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhaha
[27/2/25, 2:36:39 PM] HengHongLee: made some transactions in the morning
[27/2/25, 2:36:44 PM] HengHongLee: but >50k had some issues
[27/2/25, 2:36:59 PM] Praise: Ah yea. Read all the messages lol
[27/2/25, 2:37:29 PM] Sandra Fortune: Speed read!
[27/2/25, 2:37:37 PM] HengHongLee: but i think even if we did do >50k it would have gone through pesonet and maybe even bigger issue coz its slow
[27/2/25, 2:38:12 PM] HengHongLee: so maybe lucky it didnt have the RFI. but the pre-fee count was really messing us up lol
[27/2/25, 2:39:05 PM] Praise: Hmm
[27/2/25, 2:39:36 PM] HengHongLee: also @⁨Praise⁩ i think we need to re-look some things

1. bundles without batch quotes dont work
2. ⁠bundle creates too many quotes esp on pdax side they cannot handle the spike, hitting limits
[27/2/25, 2:40:33 PM] Praise: Ah yea. I asked then if there would be a case we won’t have batched quote ‎<This message was edited>
[27/2/25, 2:40:47 PM] Praise: But at what scenario won’t it be batches tho?
[27/2/25, 2:40:58 PM] HengHongLee: yeah i tried to do the last step with a bundle of 2
[27/2/25, 2:41:01 PM] HengHongLee: 40k and 10k
[27/2/25, 2:41:03 PM] HengHongLee: in a csv file
[27/2/25, 2:41:06 PM] Praise: Way too many quotes 😂 yes let’s see if can be optimised
[27/2/25, 2:41:38 PM] Praise: Ah. I see. So it had only 1 step right?
[27/2/25, 2:41:50 PM] HengHongLee: yeah it had 2 one-steps
[27/2/25, 2:42:07 PM] Praise: Hmmm. Ok you’re right. I’ll work on that
[27/2/25, 2:43:12 PM] HengHongLee: its ok no rush, we can discuss more on our call later
[27/2/25, 2:43:39 PM] Praise: Yes. I’ll just take a look at it to understand what to do
[27/2/25, 2:45:53 PM] HengHongLee: 3. error message broke on the csv upload (but i think maybe the csv download pr broke it)
[27/2/25, 2:46:41 PM] Praise: Hmmm, would also check that out
[27/2/25, 2:47:07 PM] Praise: Haha. Yes 🙂
[27/2/25, 2:48:00 PM] Praise: And can only stay max 3 days. Don’t ask why 💀💀💀

[4/3/25, 3:47:03 PM] Praise: So on the 50k thing we don’t need any other modifications right? @⁨Ben Menyala⁩
[4/3/25, 3:49:22 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya seems like we don’t need to
[4/3/25, 3:49:28 PM] Ben Menyala: But the RFI piece
[4/3/25, 3:49:34 PM] Ben Menyala: We might need to handle programmatically?
[4/3/25, 3:50:02 PM] Ben Menyala: Do we need to change the csv fields to get the input data required for RFI?
[4/3/25, 3:57:40 PM] Praise: Yes we would do that.
[4/3/25, 3:58:03 PM] Ben Menyala: Okayy we’ll probably need to give ample a heads up once we have that changed
[4/3/25, 3:58:18 PM] Sandra Fortune: yes. let's do that.
[4/3/25, 3:58:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos QY will need to brief his ops people
[4/3/25, 3:58:47 PM] Praise: Yea when I am done would let u know

‎[5/3/25, 1:22:28 AM] Praise: ‎image omitted
[5/3/25, 1:23:48 AM] Praise: Goodnews, Yes AMPLE won’t experience rate limit. They can upload as much as they want now and won’t be rate limited. For our account, we are rate limited because we are using DP pdax account. So the path requires calling ample per entry. But that is not the case for AMPLE.
[5/3/25, 7:53:21 AM] HengHongLee: yeah they can upload as many as they want but not getQuotes for them too many times in a row

[5/3/25, 7:55:42 AM] HengHongLee: actually its quite cool if you could ask questions about our codebase/features of our product from slack to the AI

‎[5/3/25, 7:56:27 AM] Praise: ‎sticker omitted
[5/3/25, 7:56:47 AM] Praise: It might probably know more than us. Never can tell 🙂

[5/3/25, 12:04:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: Nice. So the RFI thing - no more an issue ?
[5/3/25, 12:05:02 PM] HengHongLee: RFI thing praise will still need some work
[5/3/25, 12:05:31 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ they said i should change to `PAY-TO-ACCOUNT-REAL-TIME` from `PAY-TO-ACCOUNT-NON-REAL-TIME` right?
[5/3/25, 12:08:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Ooooo
[5/3/25, 12:08:26 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me stress test first then I tell them

[5/3/25, 12:08:57 PM] Ben Menyala: If they auto switch to pesonet and instapay
[5/3/25, 12:09:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: What category - the non real time vs real time
[5/3/25, 12:09:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Based on amount
[5/3/25, 12:09:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[5/3/25, 12:09:09 PM] HengHongLee: i guess its a flag that tells us if pdax should split the txn
[5/3/25, 12:09:10 PM] Ben Menyala: It’s a joke
[5/3/25, 12:09:20 PM] HengHongLee: AI praise is good. doesnt need sleep

[5/3/25, 4:00:01 PM] Praise: The rates kinda far apart
[5/3/25, 4:04:30 PM] Praise: "New quote (57.196) is more expensive (57.234)"

[5/3/25, 4:08:09 PM] Sandra Fortune: buying to go laundrymat?
[5/3/25, 4:08:28 PM] HengHongLee: lol
[5/3/25, 4:09:32 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ we need a switch that can accept the current rates and pay the diff
[5/3/25, 4:09:57 PM] Praise: But no funds in the system
[5/3/25, 4:10:02 PM] Praise: So if we accept how?
[5/3/25, 4:10:07 PM] HengHongLee: yeah xweave should lend them
[5/3/25, 4:10:10 PM] HengHongLee: can be a feature
[5/3/25, 4:10:11 PM] Praise: Hmm
[5/3/25, 4:10:11 PM] Ben Menyala: wahhh
[5/3/25, 4:10:19 PM] Ben Menyala: We touch the money like that
[5/3/25, 4:10:29 PM] Ben Menyala: i think we should put a timer on the execute quote button
[5/3/25, 4:10:33 PM] Ben Menyala: and force them to regenerate quote
[5/3/25, 4:10:43 PM] Praise: Regardless. Can still happen tho
[5/3/25, 4:10:45 PM] HengHongLee: its already regenerating every 20s
[5/3/25, 4:11:02 PM] Sandra Fortune: programmable.
[5/3/25, 4:11:08 PM] Ben Menyala: ohh maybe need 10s
[5/3/25, 4:11:17 PM] HengHongLee: nah
[5/3/25, 4:11:20 PM] Ben Menyala: aiya
[5/3/25, 4:11:22 PM] Ben Menyala: actly its pdax
[5/3/25, 4:11:25 PM] Ben Menyala: they need to give us rate lock
[5/3/25, 4:11:33 PM] Ben Menyala: going to send angry milind there
[5/3/25, 4:11:37 PM] Ben Menyala: get rate lock
[5/3/25, 4:11:47 PM] Ben Menyala: and then get angry sandra to say cannot give us more spread
[5/3/25, 4:12:07 PM] HengHongLee: or we add one bps
[5/3/25, 4:12:15 PM] Praise: Yes. Can
[5/3/25, 4:12:28 PM] Praise: But rate can still change
[5/3/25, 4:12:32 PM] Praise: Cuz we don’t control it
[5/3/25, 4:12:49 PM] Praise: It’s only better if the rates are assured
[5/3/25, 4:12:55 PM] HengHongLee: yeah
[5/3/25, 4:13:23 PM] HengHongLee: almost 5pm do we need a backup plan?
[5/3/25, 4:13:28 PM] Praise: Haha
[5/3/25, 4:13:36 PM] Ben Menyala: what's the difference now
[5/3/25, 4:13:42 PM] Ben Menyala: i think 4.30pm we check again
[5/3/25, 4:13:47 PM] HengHongLee: {"message":"New quote (57.182) is more expensive (57.234)","source":"TypeScriptSDK","applicationFailureInfo":{"type":"PdaxNewQuoteMoreExpensiveError"}}
[5/3/25, 4:14:00 PM] Ben Menyala: what's the shortfall ah
[5/3/25, 4:15:29 PM] Ben Menyala: if we need to top up how much ah
[5/3/25, 4:15:39 PM] HengHongLee: u can count it
[5/3/25, 4:15:51 PM] Ben Menyala: okay let me count
[5/3/25, 4:16:21 PM] HengHongLee: but we don't have to ability to take rate ‎<This message was edited>
[5/3/25, 4:16:29 PM] HengHongLee: need to build it out
[5/3/25, 4:17:03 PM] HengHongLee: what we have is ample have extra 200php inside their pdax
[5/3/25, 4:17:37 PM] Praise: We can add a new column to the quote to take up to some % difference. And if the rate is within that should take it
[5/3/25, 4:18:01 PM] HengHongLee: need some ability to signal the workflow to take the current rate
[5/3/25, 4:18:06 PM] Ben Menyala: ohhh
[5/3/25, 4:18:39 PM] HengHongLee: don't need, just make it take the rate in the next run
[5/3/25, 4:18:54 PM] HengHongLee: set a flag on workflow
[5/3/25, 4:19:09 PM] Praise: Ah. So we signal the workflow and say take current rate
[5/3/25, 4:19:18 PM] HengHongLee: yea
[5/3/25, 4:19:25 PM] Praise: Makes sense
[5/3/25, 4:19:54 PM] HengHongLee: maybe try to add it now
[5/3/25, 4:19:55 PM] Ben Menyala: i think we need about 229 pesos
[5/3/25, 4:20:00 PM] Ben Menyala: to be safe
[5/3/25, 4:20:10 PM] HengHongLee: i think have
[5/3/25, 4:20:12 PM] Praise: I can do it
[5/3/25, 4:20:15 PM] Praise: Let me try it
[5/3/25, 4:20:15 PM] Ben Menyala: okay can
[5/3/25, 4:20:40 PM] Ben Menyala: let's stop the workflow and then execute these txns manually 1 by 1?
[5/3/25, 4:20:57 PM] Praise: Let’s do this first @⁨Ben Menyala⁩
[5/3/25, 4:21:01 PM] Ben Menyala: ohh
[5/3/25, 4:21:04 PM] Ben Menyala: okay nice
[5/3/25, 4:21:08 PM] Ben Menyala: yeahh that makes sense
[5/3/25, 4:21:10 PM] Ben Menyala: let's try that
[5/3/25, 4:21:47 PM] HengHongLee: need to signal the workflow to pass take any rate to the next activity run
[5/3/25, 4:23:06 PM] HengHongLee: meanwhile can send 10 usdc matic  to their pax deposit address
[5/3/25, 4:23:30 PM] HengHongLee: and manually swap
[5/3/25, 4:23:42 PM] Ben Menyala: i think they have enough pesos?
[5/3/25, 4:23:58 PM] HengHongLee: the address i sent qy yesterday @⁨Ben Menyala⁩
[5/3/25, 4:24:00 PM] Ben Menyala: i think we actly need 194 pesos
[5/3/25, 4:24:15 PM] HengHongLee: just in case bba
[5/3/25, 4:24:19 PM] Ben Menyala: so technically the 200 pesos inside should be enough
[5/3/25, 4:24:25 PM] Ben Menyala: we try to use their money first ba
[5/3/25, 4:24:28 PM] HengHongLee: ok ok
[5/3/25, 4:24:44 PM] Ben Menyala: if cannot i'll prep some to send over
[5/3/25, 4:25:12 PM] HengHongLee: must ensure enough money before triggering the signal
[5/3/25, 4:25:30 PM] HengHongLee: actually it's fine
[5/3/25, 4:25:41 PM] HengHongLee: of one has not enough money
[5/3/25, 4:25:43 PM] HengHongLee: if
[5/3/25, 4:26:00 PM] HengHongLee: will re try
[5/3/25, 4:26:08 PM] Ben Menyala: ya it'll retry
[5/3/25, 4:26:14 PM] Ben Menyala: and i think will be okay cos it's now nearer

[5/3/25, 10:03:50 PM] HengHongLee: haha nice
[5/3/25, 10:09:30 PM] HengHongLee: anyway we need to brainstorm a solution for the quote-more-expensive
[5/3/25, 10:09:55 PM] HengHongLee: right now the limit is just removed so ample might draw down from that php reserve in pdax (~$10 worth) ‎<This message was edited>
[5/3/25, 10:10:40 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ we probably should figure out how to do that triggering of activity to remove that check on demand
[5/3/25, 10:13:28 PM] Praise: Yes so what I did is create like a signal controller. That we pass in the workflow id, the signal and the args ‎<This message was edited>
[5/3/25, 10:13:44 PM] Praise: So can be used dynamically incase we have other signaling we wanna do
[5/3/25, 10:13:53 PM] Praise: What do you think
[5/3/25, 10:14:10 PM] HengHongLee: hmm we could just signal with the temporal web UI
[5/3/25, 10:14:12 PM] HengHongLee: its easier
[5/3/25, 10:14:20 PM] Praise: Oh really
[5/3/25, 10:14:21 PM] Praise: Lmao
[5/3/25, 10:14:24 PM] Praise: 💀

[6/3/25, 5:39:03 PM] HengHongLee: seems like callback not sent
[6/3/25, 5:39:27 PM] Praise: Maybe because we spam them?

[6/3/25, 5:41:23 PM] Praise: Can see them now
[6/3/25, 5:42:12 PM] Praise: Think we need to query pdax to see the status?
[6/3/25, 5:42:41 PM] HengHongLee: i did ‎<This message was edited>
[6/3/25, 5:42:50 PM] HengHongLee: and it showed me IN-PROGRESs

[6/3/25, 5:42:57 PM] HengHongLee: this is the result from getstatus api query ‎<This message was edited>
[6/3/25, 5:43:11 PM] Praise: I thought this was our log. haha
[6/3/25, 5:43:27 PM] Praise: Think we need to ask them?
[6/3/25, 5:43:39 PM] Praise: Over 30mins is no longer instant
[6/3/25, 5:43:49 PM] HengHongLee: ya we should ask them @⁨Ben Menyala⁩
[6/3/25, 5:44:22 PM] Praise: Is Ben around? Or I ask them on their slack?
[6/3/25, 5:44:37 PM] HengHongLee: https://xweave.sentry.io/issues/6336410662/?environment=production&project=4507643496431616&query=is%3Aunresolved%20is%3Afor_review&referrer=issue-stream&statsPeriod=24h&stream_index=3 seems like it already took the money 😀
[6/3/25, 5:44:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: ben's in a meeting. sorry - was in another discussion.
[6/3/25, 5:44:44 PM] HengHongLee: yeah ask on their slack
[6/3/25, 5:47:41 PM] Praise: Yea
[6/3/25, 5:54:14 PM] Praise: I think the funds are probably already sent out
[6/3/25, 5:54:28 PM] HengHongLee: i dont think so its just withheld
[6/3/25, 5:54:37 PM] Praise: hmm
[6/3/25, 6:05:22 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me check
[6/3/25, 6:08:01 PM] Ben Menyala: The money left the account already?
[6/3/25, 6:08:10 PM] HengHongLee: i think its withheld
[6/3/25, 6:08:54 PM] HengHongLee: its shown as processing on pdax site
‎[6/3/25, 6:09:07 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[6/3/25, 6:15:13 PM] HengHongLee: and pdax account still shows to have full amount although api they alr deduct
[6/3/25, 6:19:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Means it’s still there
[6/3/25, 6:19:38 PM] Ben Menyala: Withheld ahh
[6/3/25, 6:19:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Doesn’t seem to be the wallet problems since got both gcash and maya
[6/3/25, 6:19:56 PM] HengHongLee: it happened before they will refund if failed
[6/3/25, 6:19:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Pdax api problem probably
[6/3/25, 6:20:09 PM] HengHongLee: yeah its waiting on something on their side
[6/3/25, 6:20:16 PM] HengHongLee: or their channel partner
[6/3/25, 6:20:34 PM] Ben Menyala: I think if there’s cost to resend in our term sheet they are actually liable
[6/3/25, 6:20:42 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos it’s their api
[6/3/25, 6:21:56 PM] Sandra Fortune: yes.
[6/3/25, 6:23:38 PM] Ben Menyala: But it’s okay cos now already in pesos
[6/3/25, 6:23:56 PM] Ben Menyala: But if there’s SLA for delayed payments we sign with client next time then I guess can pass on the cost hahahaha
[6/3/25, 6:24:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: yeah - something to note for with PDAX partnership agreement.
[6/3/25, 6:24:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: still have 1 bundle being process. 
What can be done ? Cancel?
[6/3/25, 6:24:58 PM] Ben Menyala: This one not in MOA right
[6/3/25, 6:25:08 PM] Ben Menyala: We can’t cancel cos it’s stuck at pdax side
[6/3/25, 6:25:15 PM] Ben Menyala: And they might release the funds anytime
[6/3/25, 6:26:26 PM] Ben Menyala: On another note looks like we got connected to Cebuana hahah
[6/3/25, 6:26:46 PM] Sandra Fortune: no. this one should be with partnership with us.
[6/3/25, 6:26:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: that's the one I want to talk to Mark about - but today he has no mind space.
[6/3/25, 6:27:16 PM] Sandra Fortune: ok. so we can do nothing but wait for PDAX.
[6/3/25, 6:27:29 PM] Sandra Fortune: hahaha.. yeah - I saw Kit's note -- woo hoo!
‎[6/3/25, 7:23:39 PM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[6/3/25, 7:24:48 PM] Ben Menyala: The top one is bundle
[6/3/25, 7:24:54 PM] Ben Menyala: The second one should be correct I think
[6/3/25, 7:24:58 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ah ok
[6/3/25, 7:24:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Does it look correct ah
[6/3/25, 7:25:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: But it’s missing 4th
[6/3/25, 7:25:07 PM] Ben Menyala: We got quite a bit of txns right
[6/3/25, 7:25:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Did we do anything on 4th
[6/3/25, 7:25:23 PM] Sandra Fortune: Think we did
[6/3/25, 7:25:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ample do txn daily
[6/3/25, 7:25:39 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya I need to double check
[6/3/25, 7:25:47 PM] Ben Menyala: I think that query needs to double check
[6/3/25, 7:26:16 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah. Ok. 
Can tell him > 100
[6/3/25, 7:26:19 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahah
[6/3/25, 7:26:49 PM] Sandra Fortune: As our txn from 1st Feb to today is about 1.5 page ?
[6/3/25, 7:27:05 PM] Sandra Fortune: If I set it to 100 per page
[6/3/25, 7:32:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: 4 pages of 50 - last page has 17 txn there hours
[6/3/25, 7:32:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: Abouts* 
Hahhaha
[6/3/25, 7:39:29 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oops - need to remove the cancelled ones Hahha
[6/3/25, 7:42:09 PM] HengHongLee: yeah need to remove those marked correction also
[6/3/25, 7:42:36 PM] HengHongLee: which is the topups and the 2 10sgd-> php ones we did yesterday
[6/3/25, 7:53:08 PM] Sandra Fortune: 😱
[6/3/25, 7:53:20 PM] Sandra Fortune: It’s ok. I am going to leave it at 156 hahaha

[6/3/25, 7:57:17 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oooohhh.. Connect connect
[6/3/25, 7:58:10 PM] Praise: p2p. hmm
[6/3/25, 7:59:03 PM] Sandra Fortune: Actually hmmm… I am not sure how they do this 
Like a whole lot of promise and not sure how they are going to deliver it
[6/3/25, 8:00:37 PM] Praise: I can imagine how they would do it. They probably have liquidity providers in different currencies. So they get matched with eachother depending on the request
[6/3/25, 8:01:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hmm… in this way - will the amounts up for trade be limited ?
[6/3/25, 8:02:04 PM] Praise: but p2p is illegal in many countries
[6/3/25, 8:02:26 PM] Praise: Yea it’s all dependent on how liquid they are?
[6/3/25, 8:15:42 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah … and most times they are not as liquid as we want them to be 😬 maybe that’s why p2p - can’t do corp flows or treasury
[6/3/25, 9:21:19 PM] Sandra Fortune: PDAX is still at it ! Oh man … must be a bad issue ….
[6/3/25, 9:21:43 PM] Praise: So crazy man
[6/3/25, 9:44:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: The 2 txn Andrew flag out - they are for banks ? Not for wallets (gcash/maya) ?
[6/3/25, 9:45:11 PM] Praise: Let me check
[6/3/25, 9:45:28 PM] Praise: Which 2?
[6/3/25, 9:45:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: Thanks @⁨Praise⁩

But the rest of the txn are still processing ‎<This message was edited>
[6/3/25, 9:46:20 PM] Ben Menyala: I think its the bank side
[6/3/25, 9:46:49 PM] Praise: I won’t call it flag 🙃
[6/3/25, 9:46:51 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. If they are bank txn - make sense
[6/3/25, 9:47:44 PM] Sandra Fortune: I mean Andrew shared that these 2 txn are accepted but under review
[7/3/25, 8:44:20 AM] Ben Menyala: Trump signed an executive order to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve. The reserve will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the reserve. The secretaries of treasury and commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin.
[7/3/25, 8:45:16 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha when governments can confiscate sound decentralised money and then use it as reserve, is it still sound? 🤔 @⁨HengHongLee⁩ ‎<This message was edited>
[7/3/25, 8:48:14 AM] HengHongLee: yeah sound means cannot debase
[7/3/25, 8:51:33 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha okay not questioning sound questioning decentralised I guess
[7/3/25, 8:52:15 AM] HengHongLee: bitcoin is not like ethereum having more bitcoin doesnt give any voting rights on protocol changes
[7/3/25, 9:05:41 AM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh I understand it’s decentralised by design but wondering what happens when there’s more and more centralised control
[7/3/25, 9:06:21 AM] HengHongLee: probably more price manipulation
[7/3/25, 9:06:30 AM] Ben Menyala: But damm guess usd is well hedged man
[7/3/25, 9:07:00 AM] Ben Menyala: Guess btc was a potential threat to its dominance as reserve currency
[7/3/25, 9:13:22 AM] HengHongLee: i guess this is buy the dip time for btc. up only from here
[7/3/25, 9:13:38 AM] HengHongLee: nation state adoption game theory is now on
[7/3/25, 9:37:37 AM] Sandra Fortune: Guys - deviate from bitcoin reserve topic and the scams on how trump is making US great again and how he is fighting de-dollarisation 
…. Kekekeke
[7/3/25, 9:38:06 AM] Sandra Fortune: The processing status then on the 9 txn is incorrect - 
So PDAX not feeding us correct status ?
[7/3/25, 9:38:14 AM] Ben Menyala: They haven’t given us callback
[7/3/25, 9:38:25 AM] Ben Menyala: We need to poll their api to get updated status
[7/3/25, 9:38:35 AM] Ben Menyala: HH Asking for callback
[7/3/25, 9:39:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ah. Ok. 
So it’s PDAX not giving us proper call back
[7/3/25, 9:40:31 AM] HengHongLee: yeah but also 8 txn are completed and 2 are not
[7/3/25, 9:40:47 AM] HengHongLee: u can update ample with that
[7/3/25, 9:41:18 AM] HengHongLee: Hi @Sandra @Benjamin @HengHong @Praise regarding these 8 transactions:

aa1d1b75-149d-48bc-a646-0a3acd8ae660

Apologies there was a bit of confusion during the initial investigation. These 8 transactions should have been credited to the beneficiary.
[7/3/25, 9:42:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: I read it as all completed 😬
[7/3/25, 9:42:51 AM] HengHongLee: ok i think 8 are and got one yesterday they say completed
[7/3/25, 9:42:54 AM] Ben Menyala: I think all completed too
[7/3/25, 9:42:58 AM] Ben Menyala: I double confirming
[7/3/25, 9:43:02 AM] HengHongLee: we have 10missing callbacks basically
[7/3/25, 9:43:12 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahhahaha ….
[7/3/25, 9:43:47 AM] HengHongLee: on our system all 10 have no callbacks but im sure most are done now
[7/3/25, 9:45:35 AM] HengHongLee: once everything sent can just tell ample alr
[7/3/25, 9:49:52 AM] Ben Menyala: Maybe we can use retool or some platform for our internal admin portal for polling
[7/3/25, 9:50:04 AM] Ben Menyala: Just to check status manually hahah
[7/3/25, 9:50:24 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay once Andrew confirmed I’ll let them know
[7/3/25, 10:15:21 AM] HengHongLee: let me check them manually
[7/3/25, 10:15:27 AM] HengHongLee: i dont think i want to wait for the callbacks
[7/3/25, 10:15:55 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ya . Once confirmed probably just let ample know that PDAX has solved them.
[7/3/25, 10:20:58 AM] HengHongLee: ok conformed all completed
[7/3/25, 10:21:37 AM] HengHongLee: can tell ample
[7/3/25, 10:21:41 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ @⁨Ben Menyala⁩
[7/3/25, 10:25:26 AM] Ben Menyala: Ok nice thanks!!
[7/3/25, 10:26:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yay !!!!
[7/3/25, 12:14:13 PM] HengHongLee: can ask them to investigate furthur on the cause?
[7/3/25, 12:14:39 PM] HengHongLee: is it the rate of requests? coz this is the one that we have done the most
[7/3/25, 12:14:44 PM] HengHongLee: at the same time
[7/3/25, 12:15:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Ok let me ask
[7/3/25, 1:07:59 PM] HengHongLee: ooh this morning ample didnt make txns
[7/3/25, 1:08:20 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ya. Never 
They typically send afternoon after their ops team took over from QY
[7/3/25, 1:08:27 PM] HengHongLee: ah i se
[7/3/25, 1:08:29 PM] HengHongLee: ok
[7/3/25, 1:08:30 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’ve been observing their pattern hahaha
[7/3/25, 1:08:42 PM] HengHongLee: 👀👀
[7/3/25, 1:08:45 PM] Ben Menyala: maybe after pdax issue they taking a break
[7/3/25, 1:08:52 PM] Ben Menyala: let our system rest
[7/3/25, 1:09:07 PM] Sandra Fortune: 😬😬😬
[7/3/25, 1:10:05 PM] HengHongLee: our system still waiting for these callbacks they promised us
[7/3/25, 1:10:21 PM] HengHongLee: should i cancel and doctor the books manually?
[7/3/25, 1:12:11 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hmm… any impact if we don’t do any changes ? Currently the txn are listed as completed already
[7/3/25, 1:12:39 PM] HengHongLee: no issue but if they not going to send i need to patch it up
[7/3/25, 1:12:41 PM] HengHongLee: manually
[7/3/25, 1:12:59 PM] HengHongLee: https://app.xweave.io/bundle?id=c90ae317-1836-4274-81ef-17656d2b4e14&view=execute&highlight=85eda1e1-e69a-43e9-a85c-5838b0354971
[7/3/25, 1:13:14 PM] HengHongLee: if u see here the 10 transactions still step 0/1
[7/3/25, 1:13:17 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ah. Are we able to patch it maybe Monday ? Ample can still process new txn ?
[7/3/25, 1:13:28 PM] HengHongLee: yeah can patch it up anytime
[7/3/25, 1:13:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: What do you guys think ?
[7/3/25, 1:14:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: We can patch la - no issue. Since we have confirmation that it’s all good.
[7/3/25, 1:14:39 PM] Sandra Fortune: I think down side if we don’t patch is that bundle doesnt seems to be properly completed although at txn level it is
[7/3/25, 1:14:46 PM] Sandra Fortune: And ample gets worried
[7/3/25, 1:15:15 PM] HengHongLee: i waiting for pdax to fulfil their promise of sending us callbacks
[7/3/25, 1:15:18 PM] HengHongLee: 😀
[7/3/25, 1:15:27 PM] HengHongLee: give them up till monday then
[7/3/25, 1:15:56 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. I’m good 
@⁨Ben Menyala⁩ ? 
@⁨Praise⁩ - sorry dude … you are asleep so shall not wait for your vote 🤣🤣🤣
[7/3/25, 1:16:10 PM] HengHongLee: haha its not a big deal actually
[7/3/25, 1:16:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe give them till this evening ba, if not we should patch
[7/3/25, 1:16:36 PM] Ben Menyala: cos the ops ppl or QY might think it's still not done
[7/3/25, 1:16:36 PM] HengHongLee: ok
[7/3/25, 1:16:37 PM] Ben Menyala: lolol
[7/3/25, 1:16:41 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah. I thought so too.  Not time critical
[7/3/25, 1:16:43 PM] Ben Menyala: i;ll chase up
[7/3/25, 1:17:00 PM] HengHongLee: i set the status to Completed already
[7/3/25, 1:17:03 PM] HengHongLee: for all the transactions
[7/3/25, 1:17:10 PM] HengHongLee: its just that the ledgers arent complete
[7/3/25, 1:19:04 PM] Ben Menyala: ohhh
[7/3/25, 1:19:31 PM] Ben Menyala: then that's okay
[7/3/25, 1:19:35 PM] Ben Menyala: i think can wait callback
[7/3/25, 1:19:40 PM] Ben Menyala: anyhow i chsae up
[7/3/25, 1:19:44 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah. Let’s wait
[7/3/25, 1:19:54 PM] HengHongLee: haha no biggie can wait one
[7/3/25, 1:19:55 PM] Ben Menyala: how's tioman
[7/3/25, 1:20:03 PM] HengHongLee: chill
[7/3/25, 1:20:04 PM] Ben Menyala: got any photos
[7/3/25, 1:20:13 PM] Ben Menyala: i wanna see whether you really became buff or if it's that shirt
[7/3/25, 1:20:21 PM] HengHongLee: is fat
[7/3/25, 1:20:26 PM] HengHongLee: no pictures lol
[7/3/25, 1:20:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahhahahhahahahahahah …. This Ben ah
[7/3/25, 1:21:12 PM] Sandra Fortune: Not as stressful as his drive there 😬😬😬
He “omg” so many times already
[7/3/25, 1:40:21 PM] HengHongLee: i tot the whole workflow restarted
[7/3/25, 1:40:25 PM] HengHongLee: and resend
[7/3/25, 1:40:36 PM] HengHongLee: ah later i need to go figure out how it actually works
[7/3/25, 1:41:16 PM] Ben Menyala: LOLLLL
[7/3/25, 1:41:25 PM] Ben Menyala: That was so epic
[7/3/25, 1:42:12 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. You can figure it out when you are back to office
[7/3/25, 1:42:34 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahaha IKR ! 
@⁨HengHongLee⁩ - Ben & I were laughing loudly in the office ‎<This message was edited>
[7/3/25, 1:48:34 PM] HengHongLee: ah we need to calculate the final rate
[7/3/25, 1:52:11 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh ya how to calculate ah
[7/3/25, 1:52:17 PM] Ben Menyala: Need to back calculate for just that txn?
[7/3/25, 1:52:40 PM] Ben Menyala: Actly cannot we need to split across the entire bundle and recalculate
[7/3/25, 1:52:51 PM] HengHongLee: yah need to split across bundle
[7/3/25, 1:53:38 PM] HengHongLee: can i do that later? i try to figure out how to make it properly reflect in the transaction table
[7/3/25, 1:54:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Can ba I’ll ask QY
[7/3/25, 1:56:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: Let QY know that we are in the midst of checking that number and will keep him updated
[7/3/25, 1:56:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Saw your response … Hahha ..

‎[7/3/25, 2:39:00 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[7/3/25, 2:39:31 PM] HengHongLee: if we can i think the system (will maybe) recalculate the new cost of each txn?
[7/3/25, 2:39:42 PM] Praise: Hmm
[7/3/25, 2:40:01 PM] HengHongLee: probably not actually
[7/3/25, 2:40:06 PM] HengHongLee: coz the amounts are all different
[7/3/25, 2:40:13 PM] Praise: Yea I don’t see how either
[7/3/25, 2:41:03 PM] Praise: side note, we need to add back the more expensive thing else it might keep drawing more money when we do not want?
[7/3/25, 2:41:56 PM] Praise: I don’t think we can update the rates, why don’t we tell them its some cost?
[7/3/25, 2:42:37 PM] Praise: Because the steps were totally unrelated to the bundle I am thinking how we can merge it
[7/3/25, 2:42:40 PM] Ben Menyala: They need it for their accounting purposes
[7/3/25, 2:42:51 PM] Praise: Yea crazy man
[7/3/25, 2:42:56 PM] Ben Menyala: So they wanna know that’s the exact sgd for that txn haha
[7/3/25, 2:48:02 PM] HengHongLee: it makes sense their request is totally reasonable im just trying to think what makes the most sense from an accounting pov
[7/3/25, 2:48:26 PM] HengHongLee: need to spread the additional cost across the entire bundle
[7/3/25, 2:48:34 PM] HengHongLee: amount weighted
[7/3/25, 2:50:50 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya we should do that
[7/3/25, 2:51:10 PM] Ben Menyala: But then the actual php disbursed will change right
[7/3/25, 2:51:10 PM] Praise: Let me think too
[7/3/25, 2:51:29 PM] HengHongLee: actually i think its better to make the bundle what actually happend
[7/3/25, 2:51:39 PM] HengHongLee: and then the rest we just move into the correction txns
[7/3/25, 2:52:05 PM] Ben Menyala: But what will be the rate though
[7/3/25, 2:52:13 PM] HengHongLee: the rate that we actually swapped at
[7/3/25, 2:52:14 PM] Ben Menyala: Or maybe we take that spoilt txn out
[7/3/25, 2:52:17 PM] Ben Menyala: And give it its own rate
[7/3/25, 2:52:23 PM] Ben Menyala: The rest can still take the bundle rate
[7/3/25, 2:52:28 PM] HengHongLee: the rest of the money is still in pdax
[7/3/25, 2:52:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya don’t think they care about the rest of the money
[7/3/25, 2:53:13 PM] Ben Menyala: They wanna know the 110 pesos shortfall (or whatever we used) how much sgd did it take and then how that spoilt txn would have really costed them
[7/3/25, 2:53:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Think more for accounting and reporting to MAS
[7/3/25, 2:53:40 PM] Sandra Fortune: that and for the books as well.
[7/3/25, 2:53:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: are you guys doing weighted or across
[7/3/25, 2:54:21 PM] Ben Menyala: I think we cannot do weighted cos the actual pesos vs the new pesos calculated will be different
[7/3/25, 2:54:25 PM] HengHongLee: its ok i just pretend that everything was enough at the new rate
[7/3/25, 2:54:43 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohhh
[7/3/25, 2:54:57 PM] HengHongLee: and the correction just moved money from sgd to pdax php
[7/3/25, 2:55:03 PM] HengHongLee: unrelated
[7/3/25, 2:55:14 PM] HengHongLee: thats probably what they want
[7/3/25, 3:33:43 PM] HengHongLee: https://app.xweave.io/bundle?id=68e0b8ce-50ba-46e7-9a48-bb606605d20e&view=execute&highlight=657b4e3b-ef80-4c47-985d-f9266c9738e6
[7/3/25, 3:34:03 PM] HengHongLee: ok the bundle and transactions should be updated
[7/3/25, 3:34:39 PM] HengHongLee: but still alot of changes required
[7/3/25, 3:38:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: ample send more transactions through
[7/3/25, 3:38:12 PM] Sandra Fortune: they send some at 1 then another bunch at 3.
[7/3/25, 3:38:19 PM] Sandra Fortune: all looking good.
[7/3/25, 3:38:30 PM] HengHongLee: yup all done
[7/3/25, 3:38:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: nice
[7/3/25, 3:39:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Can buy 4D

[7/3/25, 3:40:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Niceee
[7/3/25, 3:40:27 PM] Praise: What dod you do to match it?
[7/3/25, 3:41:34 PM] HengHongLee: i basically changed the orderroute/steps/extquote metadatas to make it though it moved 5010sgd instead of 4999.96sgd
[7/3/25, 3:41:52 PM] HengHongLee: but i havent finished changing the actual ledgers
[7/3/25, 3:42:13 PM] Sandra Fortune: doctoring...
[7/3/25, 3:42:14 PM] HengHongLee: its gonna be super hard since we have running balance
[7/3/25, 3:42:32 PM] HengHongLee: this is beyond doctoring this one surgery lol
[7/3/25, 3:42:53 PM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣
[7/3/25, 3:44:02 PM] HengHongLee: i “cancelled” the 2 orders that moved 10sgd over to pdax php
[7/3/25, 3:44:30 PM] HengHongLee: but this mostly just fixes it cosmetically. can download the csv everything
[7/3/25, 3:45:04 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay can

[7/3/25, 3:50:02 PM] Praise: Nice, thanks @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[7/3/25, 3:50:20 PM] Praise: You think we need to have a more cleaner way for handling things like this?
[7/3/25, 3:50:29 PM] Praise: Because I would assume this can happen again
[7/3/25, 3:51:32 PM] HengHongLee: i dont think we should _handle_ it. i think we need to make sure it doesnt happen again
[7/3/25, 3:52:05 PM] HengHongLee: which is 
1/ lock pdax longer
2/ charge a few bps more and give a rebate
3/ something dynamic
[7/3/25, 3:52:11 PM] HengHongLee: i think 2 is reasonable
[7/3/25, 3:52:12 PM] Praise: Haha, but we were thinking of having a feauture to _allow_ this again?
[7/3/25, 3:52:21 PM] Praise: Hmm
[7/3/25, 3:53:05 PM] HengHongLee: i think just make a buffer with pdax money and tell them after a few months that they actually have money squirrelled away in pdax php
[7/3/25, 3:53:05 PM] Ben Menyala: How are you thinking of the rebate ah
[7/3/25, 3:53:11 PM] Praise: Change a few bps? Like don’t use exact rate from pdax?
[7/3/25, 3:53:16 PM] HengHongLee: yeah
[7/3/25, 3:53:18 PM] Ben Menyala: I see
[7/3/25, 3:53:21 PM] Praise: Yessss, this makes sense
[7/3/25, 3:53:24 PM] Ben Menyala: But this thing can’t scale
[7/3/25, 3:53:28 PM] Praise: This is what I’ve been thinking too
[7/3/25, 3:53:29 PM] Ben Menyala: If it’s not their own pdax account
[7/3/25, 3:53:37 PM] Praise: right
[7/3/25, 3:53:39 PM] HengHongLee: wdym
[7/3/25, 3:53:44 PM] HengHongLee: ah
[7/3/25, 3:53:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos when we bring in Cebuana or dragonpay
[7/3/25, 3:53:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Then will have random money there
[7/3/25, 3:53:57 PM] Ben Menyala: From different clients
[7/3/25, 3:53:57 PM] HengHongLee: then it becomes xweave money
[7/3/25, 3:54:00 PM] HengHongLee: LOL
[7/3/25, 3:54:01 PM] Ben Menyala: LOL
[7/3/25, 3:54:02 PM] Praise: haha
[7/3/25, 3:54:04 PM] Praise: lmao
[7/3/25, 3:54:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Brooooo
[7/3/25, 3:54:10 PM] Ben Menyala: secretly send it to your wallet
[7/3/25, 3:54:13 PM] Praise: 😂
[7/3/25, 3:54:23 PM] Ben Menyala: “Clearing dust txns”
[7/3/25, 3:54:31 PM] HengHongLee: after doing 50+ transfers to make sure they cant find me
[7/3/25, 3:54:43 PM] Ben Menyala: LOLLL
[7/3/25, 3:55:26 PM] Praise: What’s this Menyala team brainstorming?
[7/3/25, 3:55:36 PM] Praise: New person finally joined?
[7/3/25, 3:55:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh
[7/3/25, 3:55:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Brainstorm ways to cut cost
[7/3/25, 3:56:08 PM] Praise: haha
[7/3/25, 3:56:10 PM] Ben Menyala: Point your finger at people you dislike is the activity
[7/3/25, 3:56:28 PM] Praise: I point finger @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ then. 🙃
[7/3/25, 3:56:42 PM] Ben Menyala: LOLLLL

[11/3/25, 1:58:10 PM] HengHongLee: Seems like the objective is to cofound with battle-tested founders, what do we deeply know about their needs/wants/incentives to provide value and have them want to cofound with menyala (other than offering them Temasek’s money and connections) and not just do it with their existing connections or even their own money.

[12/3/25, 10:23:00 AM] Ben Menyala: Every transfer of power is always chaotic I guess ‎<This message was edited>
[12/3/25, 10:24:25 AM] Sandra Fortune: it definitely sounds so. but its a little more then that. 
I am reading a very different thing all together - this guy is founder obsessed ! he thinks 1 person can CREATE a great company that can run up to series B .. .kinda binary. 
That's what i felt for that piece of thinking he had - when his so founder obsessed.
[12/3/25, 10:24:45 AM] Sandra Fortune: his just wayang only la - letting P "convince" him.
[12/3/25, 2:26:14 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - I’m so sorry ! 
Need to check with you. 
What do we need to do for ample on the compliance ask
[12/3/25, 2:30:17 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me ask is it the splitting of fees

[12/3/25, 3:44:53 PM] HengHongLee: basically we deposit to this address on matic
[12/3/25, 3:44:58 PM] HengHongLee: this is pdax wallet
[12/3/25, 3:45:04 PM] HengHongLee: they can do anything they want on it
[12/3/25, 3:45:22 PM] HengHongLee: including depositing matic for themselves or any other shitcoin
[12/3/25, 3:45:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya they say the don’t see any deposit in

[12/3/25, 5:01:28 PM] Sandra Fortune: i joined for a while and then left for a call.
[12/3/25, 5:01:35 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha
[12/3/25, 5:01:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Guess that call was the meaty one
[12/3/25, 5:02:02 PM] Sandra Fortune: was talking about menyala folks - Sonny says - 100% needs to think about moving to ventures. But of course, bearing in mind, venture needs to accept.
[12/3/25, 5:02:12 PM] Sandra Fortune: yeah. it is.
[12/3/25, 5:02:28 PM] Sandra Fortune: Minh not joining as partner - but may find other ways to work together.

[12/3/25, 5:03:24 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya confirm it’s the tech outsource hub
[12/3/25, 5:03:39 PM] Sandra Fortune: hahahaha.
[13/3/25, 8:16:18 AM] Ben Menyala: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ @⁨HengHongLee⁩ might not be able to get reception for Cebuana later - haha cos on my way up to Mt Fuji . Can help to drive the convo? 

But here’s the thing we need from them after we explain to them the xweave construct and how we want to move on from using pdax for disbursement cos it’ll be more scalable:
1. Custom API for sending out php to supported channels to our recipients (start with wallet and banks) 
2. This is done after verifying that the php has landed in their pdax account 
3. ⁠Ask them how long the transfer of php from pdax to their account will take - and whether they can help to send out  php first once they verify if it takes too long to move the php 

And then next step can tell them we set up a call with pdax to discuss all the details (plus they also haven’t send over the nda)
[13/3/25, 8:17:06 AM] Ben Menyala: Sell them we going to give them good volumes from sg / uae and so they can earn good fees hahaha
[13/3/25, 8:28:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cool. Thanks Ben for the notes. 
Mt Fuji will be super fun! Enjoy
[13/3/25, 8:29:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ - not heading to office today. Having a massive headache that’s not going away. 
But I’ll be getting on the calls

[13/3/25, 8:30:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahaha … I think I need that 
I don’t do too well in an environment that’s overwhelmingly filled with bad vibes
[13/3/25, 8:30:51 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha ya man same
[13/3/25, 8:31:25 AM] Ben Menyala: I can alr feel the bad vibes from here

[13/3/25, 8:32:43 AM] Ben Menyala: Also we need to empathize we don’t own any accounts cos we don’t touch the money in the cebuana call
[13/3/25, 8:32:53 AM] Ben Menyala: I think they might not understand this
[13/3/25, 8:32:56 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha yaaa

[13/3/25, 8:55:46 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Let me pull that out 
I’ll use the one we use for MDaq
[13/3/25, 10:22:07 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ i think we can just work directly with them without pdax
[13/3/25, 10:22:14 AM] HengHongLee: can ask them?
[13/3/25, 10:22:23 AM] HengHongLee: if they have the right licenses to recv usdc and send out php for both businesses and p2p ‎<This message was edited>

[13/3/25, 10:28:17 AM] HengHongLee: yeah they will go through pdax if its cheaper
[13/3/25, 10:28:22 AM] HengHongLee: but if its not it wont
[13/3/25, 10:28:48 AM] HengHongLee: our system should not have specific biases

[13/3/25, 10:36:46 AM] HengHongLee: fx is where people always look to earn a spread. so we should integrate as many as possible there ‎<This message was edited>

[14/3/25, 10:27:59 AM] HengHongLee: "message": "New quote (57.161) is more expensive (57.203)",
[14/3/25, 10:28:06 AM] HengHongLee: seems like stuck on exchange rate again
[14/3/25, 10:34:28 AM] HengHongLee: seems like it was off by 0.8bps at the first error
[14/3/25, 10:34:56 AM] HengHongLee: i think we need to add at least 1bp
[14/3/25, 10:35:04 AM] HengHongLee: as buffer
[14/3/25, 10:42:12 AM] HengHongLee: just 20sec between quote and order created
[14/3/25, 10:53:15 AM] Sandra Fortune: So the bundle was not sent out because of the rates ?
[14/3/25, 10:53:20 AM] HengHongLee: yes
[14/3/25, 10:53:27 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ah ok.
[14/3/25, 10:53:44 AM] HengHongLee: im just gonna use some usdc to pay for the diff
[14/3/25, 10:54:12 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ample’s USDC ?
[14/3/25, 10:54:18 AM] HengHongLee: use ours
[14/3/25, 10:54:24 AM] Sandra Fortune: We have ?
[14/3/25, 10:56:53 AM] HengHongLee: ya
[14/3/25, 10:59:17 AM] Sandra Fortune: how much ?
[14/3/25, 11:00:05 AM] Ben Menyala: Wait
[14/3/25, 11:00:08 AM] Ben Menyala: Ample has usdc inside
[14/3/25, 11:00:12 AM] Ben Menyala: Can use it to pay off
[14/3/25, 11:00:22 AM] Ben Menyala: Rmb that time we transfer 7 bucks
[14/3/25, 11:00:24 AM] Ben Menyala: Usdc
[14/3/25, 11:00:29 AM] Ben Menyala: Should be enough right
[14/3/25, 11:00:34 AM] HengHongLee: let me calculate
[14/3/25, 11:02:28 AM] HengHongLee: yeah enough
[14/3/25, 11:02:40 AM] HengHongLee: but then if use their money then need to move the ledgers again
[14/3/25, 11:03:34 AM] HengHongLee: anyway i sent them another 15usd from our funds and pushed the fix
[14/3/25, 11:03:47 AM] HengHongLee: should be done soon
[14/3/25, 11:04:00 AM] HengHongLee: need to think about a solution
[14/3/25, 11:04:13 AM] HengHongLee: id say use this, add 2
[14/3/25, 11:58:51 AM] Ben Menyala: Add 2 bps?
[14/3/25, 12:08:20 PM] HengHongLee: ya
[14/3/25, 12:08:33 PM] HengHongLee: anyway the buffer will be in their pdax
[14/3/25, 12:08:46 PM] HengHongLee: anyway im gonna make it 1bps first
[14/3/25, 12:08:53 PM] HengHongLee: if we hit this again we can increase to 2 bps
[14/3/25, 12:11:37 PM] Ben Menyala: Ok can
[14/3/25, 12:11:52 PM] Ben Menyala: Should we give ample a heads up
[14/3/25, 12:12:14 PM] Ben Menyala: And say it’ll be in their pdax acct anyway and then if it gets too much we’ll ask them to sweep it while we wait for rate lock from pdax
[14/3/25, 12:57:07 PM] HengHongLee: no need for now its very little money only
[14/3/25, 6:26:30 PM] Sandra Fortune: hey guys, need help … although a dumb request. 
I'm trying to do a calculation on incentives and can't pull out the Mid market rate from the CSV.
[14/3/25, 6:26:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: i know HH will ask me to go metabase - but i can't remember how to do it anymore  😬
[14/3/25, 6:32:53 PM] Praise: https://metabase-xweave.ngrok.io/dashboard/2-xweave-rates?tab=4-sgd-%2F-php

This?
[14/3/25, 7:45:40 PM] Sandra Fortune: Not really. 
I’m intending to pull out the transactions with mid market and difference (if can’t have both data, either one is fine as I can still compute on a spreadsheet to get either)
[14/3/25, 7:46:58 PM] Sandra Fortune: So the idea of it is downloadable Csv where I have the data and I base on formulas to calculate the subsidy that’s due to ample
[14/3/25, 7:47:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’ll send what I want later on when I get access to my spreadsheet
‎[14/3/25, 8:11:35 PM] Sandra Fortune: ‎image omitted
[14/3/25, 8:12:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: are we able to include 2 columns more which is mid market rate and difference ? 
This doesn't need to be made available to ample. Just to ourselves. is this possible ?
[14/3/25, 8:13:18 PM] Sandra Fortune: no urgency, but will be good if we can calculate the current amount we have used up for subsidy …
[14/3/25, 8:13:58 PM] Praise: Oh you want difference and market rate to be included in the csv
[14/3/25, 8:14:11 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah …
[14/3/25, 8:14:27 PM] Sandra Fortune: Is it possible ? 
Or is there any back end reports that we can use for that ?
[14/3/25, 8:14:38 PM] Praise: It can be included
[14/3/25, 8:15:15 PM] Sandra Fortune: Cool
I think it’s ok for ample to see it too. 
What do you think. ‎<This message was edited>
[14/3/25, 8:15:32 PM] Praise: Do you also want it on the transaction page?
[14/3/25, 8:15:35 PM] Praise: Or just the csv
[14/3/25, 8:15:46 PM] Sandra Fortune: Just on the Csv
[14/3/25, 8:16:25 PM] Praise: Yea once it’s Available on the csv they also can see it
[14/3/25, 8:16:45 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Should be ok. 😬
‎[15/3/25, 4:49:07 AM] Praise: ‎image omitted
[15/3/25, 8:24:07 AM] Sandra Fortune: Thank you !!🙏
[15/3/25, 9:03:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - when you are back. Let’s talk about this display. I’m asking praise to help to put in a quick fix so I can pull this out easily. 😬
But if we should have it for long term, ideally we should think how we can have it in our personal report and not pub to the client
[15/3/25, 9:06:25 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh yehh I think this should be able to be pulled from metabase
[15/3/25, 9:06:48 AM] HengHongLee: haha not sure if we want to show the diff to the customer
[15/3/25, 9:06:56 AM] Ben Menyala: That’s true hahaha ample see 5% market rate difference might faint
[15/3/25, 9:07:07 AM] HengHongLee: but we definitely do keep track of it
[15/3/25, 9:07:09 AM] Sandra Fortune: Think now it’s ok.  But not anything beyond
[15/3/25, 9:07:30 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - for now - with just ample. That’s fine since they do see our cal as well
[15/3/25, 9:07:39 AM] Sandra Fortune: But can’t be there for long
[15/3/25, 9:10:04 AM] Sandra Fortune: Would think that we should have a separate one for ourselves … we can decide how we want to do it base on access or admin page etc
[15/3/25, 9:10:21 AM] HengHongLee: yea can add to developer mode
[15/3/25, 9:10:37 AM] Sandra Fortune: 👍
[15/3/25, 9:10:50 AM] HengHongLee: is ample using the download csv now?
[15/3/25, 9:11:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: But not urgent
[15/3/25, 9:11:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: I’m using hahah .. and yes - QY is also using as we are working on commercials
[15/3/25, 9:11:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: But for now - ok to let them see
[15/3/25, 9:12:03 AM] HengHongLee: > I’m using hahah .. and yes - QY is also using

lol
[15/3/25, 9:12:26 AM] HengHongLee: u forgot how to use metabase because u went back to excel
[15/3/25, 9:13:24 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yes! Heh heh heh… suddenly very handicap
[15/3/25, 9:14:44 AM] Sandra Fortune: Mr Lee from my Metabase class will scold me soon
🤣🤣
[16/3/25, 9:41:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: oh ! they send transaction on Sunday as well ? 🤨
[16/3/25, 9:41:29 AM] HengHongLee: thats good 😀

[16/3/25, 2:55:10 PM] HengHongLee: sure, just small pack is ok
[16/3/25, 2:55:42 PM] Ben Menyala: Which one
[16/3/25, 3:33:56 PM] HengHongLee: sorry just saw
[16/3/25, 3:34:21 PM] HengHongLee: anyone is fine, but giant steps looks good
[16/3/25, 3:37:46 PM] Ben Menyala: Ok can
[16/3/25, 6:13:49 PM] Praise: Ample uploaded another that is stuck
[16/3/25, 6:16:07 PM] Praise: Stucked at straitsx
[16/3/25, 6:20:26 PM] HengHongLee: whats the error

[16/3/25, 6:21:34 PM] HengHongLee: ah straitsx no callback
[16/3/25, 6:21:44 PM] Praise: Yea
[16/3/25, 6:23:05 PM] Praise: I created a ticket to add alert systems for long running orders
[16/3/25, 6:23:56 PM] Praise: I just checked the address, `0x9d2eCd60c92D8857735005e6Ea358cf210Ae17` I didn’t see any transaction
[16/3/25, 6:24:01 PM] Praise: I don’t think it was sent
[16/3/25, 6:24:38 PM] Praise: The last transaction was 8hrs ago which was the first bundle they sent
[16/3/25, 6:25:04 PM] Praise: We might need to retrigeer the `straitsxExecuteSendQuote`
[16/3/25, 6:29:44 PM] Praise: Should we inform them we are on it?

‎[16/3/25, 6:32:16 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[16/3/25, 6:32:20 PM] HengHongLee: its stuck in pending
[16/3/25, 6:32:33 PM] HengHongLee: on straitsx side
[16/3/25, 6:32:35 PM] Sandra Fortune: So it’s straits X side
[16/3/25, 6:32:39 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[16/3/25, 6:32:40 PM] Praise: Yea it wasn’t sent
[16/3/25, 6:32:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: I can’t see # of txn in bundle.
Is it only 1 ?
[16/3/25, 6:33:14 PM] Praise: It is the batched txn
‎[16/3/25, 6:33:20 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[16/3/25, 6:33:28 PM] HengHongLee: 7 transactions
[16/3/25, 6:33:51 PM] HengHongLee: doesnt seem like theres anything we can do
[16/3/25, 6:34:04 PM] Praise: Yea
[16/3/25, 6:34:20 PM] HengHongLee: other than to push straitsx to fix their `pending` state on the transaction
[16/3/25, 6:34:35 PM] Praise: Can let AMPLE know?
[16/3/25, 6:34:58 PM] HengHongLee: sure we should let them know we know its stuck ‎<This message was edited>
[16/3/25, 6:47:17 PM] Praise: The rate would have changed by the time straitsx fixes this
[16/3/25, 6:48:39 PM] Sandra Fortune: Think we should raise this to Straits X on rate changes and talk about how we should deal with such situations
[16/3/25, 6:49:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: But for immediate - it’s goign to be similar way in how we manage PDAx rate change 😬
[16/3/25, 6:49:54 PM] Praise: I’m actually referring to pdax
[16/3/25, 6:50:11 PM] Praise: because we already generated the quote down stream
[16/3/25, 6:55:33 PM] HengHongLee: ok i submitted the support ticket
[16/3/25, 6:56:04 PM] HengHongLee: hmm currently the moreexpensive check is disabled
[16/3/25, 6:56:12 PM] HengHongLee: anyway it could be cheaper also
[16/3/25, 6:56:22 PM] HengHongLee: let me put that check back in for now
[16/3/25, 6:56:34 PM] Praise: Yea I saw that. Maybe it gets resolved in 2 weeks 🙂
[16/3/25, 6:56:53 PM] Praise: But yea it’s understandable. The guy won’t wanna work weekends
[16/3/25, 6:57:09 PM] HengHongLee: they should have people working on the weekends
[16/3/25, 6:57:31 PM] Praise: Exactly
[16/3/25, 6:57:37 PM] Praise: Let’s see
[16/3/25, 6:58:53 PM] Praise: Oh it’s already past 6pm over there
[16/3/25, 7:03:08 PM] HengHongLee: its probably not an issue but compliance flag or smth
[16/3/25, 7:03:32 PM] HengHongLee: probably they hit some send limit? idk
[16/3/25, 7:47:28 PM] HengHongLee: doesnt seem like they are replying yet
[16/3/25, 8:56:18 PM] Sandra Fortune: Any thing from them ? 
If not shall let ample know that we are still trying to get hold of them
[16/3/25, 9:00:45 PM] HengHongLee: nothing yet
[16/3/25, 9:33:49 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh let me text in the chat to give a heads up
[16/3/25, 9:34:03 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh actly they should have 24/7 tech support
[16/3/25, 9:34:58 PM] Ben Menyala: If we have to eat the fees actually it’s straitsX who’s liable I think
[16/3/25, 9:37:54 PM] HengHongLee: yeah because the money is kind of locked up now by them
[16/3/25, 9:38:11 PM] HengHongLee: but also curious why they will always get into this `pending` state
[16/3/25, 9:38:18 PM] HengHongLee: probably compliance again
[16/3/25, 9:39:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybeee limit I think

[16/3/25, 9:41:37 PM] Ben Menyala: Or maybe it’s a weekly limit
[16/3/25, 9:50:02 PM] Sandra Fortune: They didn’t state any weekly limit though … hmmmm ‎<This message was edited>
[17/3/25, 7:49:48 AM] HengHongLee: its probably like a threshold

[17/3/25, 3:00:33 PM] HengHongLee: >  "rejection_reason": "AC01"

can ask pdax what is this
[17/3/25, 3:01:10 PM] Praise: Asked
[17/3/25, 3:01:47 PM] HengHongLee: In the context of financial transactions, AC01 is a rejection code used in payment processing, particularly in SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) and other banking systems. It generally refers to "Incorrect Account Number".

Possible reasons for an AC01 rejection:
The account number provided does not exist.
The account number format is incorrect.
The recipient's bank is unable to locate the account.
The account number may have been closed or deactivated.
Since your transaction was declined with AC01, you may want to double-check the recipient's account details and retry the transaction.
[17/3/25, 3:01:59 PM] Praise: Haha
[17/3/25, 3:02:02 PM] Praise: Oh really
[17/3/25, 3:02:24 PM] HengHongLee: "beneficiary_bank_code": "BABOTPH",

[17/3/25, 3:03:31 PM] HengHongLee: BPI	 4016339268

is this a valid bpi account
ChatGPT said:
​BPI (Bank of the Philippine Islands) account numbers typically consist of 10 digits. In your case, the number "4016339268" is a 10-digit number, which aligns with BPI's standard format.​
techpilipinas.com

It's important to note that the first three digits of a BPI account number often represent the branch code. For instance, account numbers starting with "00" are commonly associated with BPI branches in Makati. ​

However, while the structure of "4016339268" matches BPI's format, this doesn't confirm the account's validity or status. For security and privacy reasons, only BPI can verify the authenticity and current status of an account number. To ensure the account is active and correct, it's advisable to contact the account holder directly or reach out to BPI's customer service for verification.

[17/3/25, 5:46:42 PM] Ben Menyala: I think same day if before 4pm

[17/3/25, 5:47:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Only if it’s union bank
[17/3/25, 5:47:48 PM] Praise: So why were we trying to enable 50k again? 😂
[17/3/25, 5:48:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos ample will be okay with T+1
[17/3/25, 5:48:13 PM] Ben Menyala: For >50k
[17/3/25, 5:48:17 PM] Praise: Oh really
[17/3/25, 5:48:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos now they also having it T+1

[17/3/25, 5:48:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Won’t be real time
[17/3/25, 5:48:38 PM] Ben Menyala: If it’s more than 50k
[17/3/25, 5:48:53 PM] Praise: Ah, Ok makes sense
[17/3/25, 5:59:10 PM] Sandra Fortune: What’s this form ? 😬
[17/3/25, 5:59:47 PM] HengHongLee: i think our form always been sending to our account holder which is arnav
[17/3/25, 6:00:06 PM] HengHongLee: this form is for refunding ample
[17/3/25, 6:00:58 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oh I see. 
Hmmmm…. The form submission is manually over email ?
[17/3/25, 6:09:27 PM] HengHongLee: the form is for crypto deposits into straitsx
[17/3/25, 6:09:35 PM] HengHongLee: the ones we always get blocked
[17/3/25, 6:10:16 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oh. So it wouldn’t be often that ample needs to do this
[17/3/25, 6:10:28 PM] HengHongLee: yes
[17/3/25, 6:21:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: Josh very busy now. He talking to me hahhahaha
‎[17/3/25, 7:09:49 PM] Praise: ‎image omitted
[17/3/25, 7:10:26 PM] Praise: I’ll probably assume there’s some api we can use to validate account number so we can do the check very early on
[17/3/25, 7:16:09 PM] Sandra Fortune: How early should we do it ?
Account bene validation is done only when execute quote flow ? 
If that’s the case validation of bene can’t be done prior ?
[17/3/25, 7:17:17 PM] Sandra Fortune: In some flows I’ve seen in other plateforms - there’s a pre-validation flow - but that means the check happen prior to txn exection 
Will add up to the complexity of checks and time bene recv
[17/3/25, 7:32:14 PM] Praise: > Quote has expired

The refund didn’t go thru
[17/3/25, 7:32:20 PM] Praise: quote expired
[17/3/25, 7:36:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Yeahh we ask pdax before
[17/3/25, 7:36:41 PM] Ben Menyala: They said the banks and ewallets don’t provide this kind of pre validation check
[17/3/25, 7:36:41 PM] Praise: I mean aside pdax
[17/3/25, 7:36:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe need a central service in Philippines
[17/3/25, 7:37:01 PM] Ben Menyala: That has all these data
[17/3/25, 7:37:05 PM] Praise: Yea smth like this
[17/3/25, 7:37:30 PM] Ben Menyala: But yeahh likely won’t be too accurate or comprehensive too, since it’s not the source of truth
[17/3/25, 7:38:15 PM] Sandra Fortune: That means we need to be part of validating been …. Hmmmmmm
[17/3/25, 7:38:22 PM] Sandra Fortune: Is this what we want to do ?
[17/3/25, 7:39:09 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha we don’t want to store all these info though
[17/3/25, 7:39:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Guess that’s why companies do hacky pre validation like 20 cents top up kind of thing
[17/3/25, 7:45:05 PM] Praise: We won’t need to store tho
[17/3/25, 7:45:27 PM] Praise: why just union? Because PDAX uses Union right?
[17/3/25, 7:45:32 PM] Ben Menyala: Yupp
[17/3/25, 7:45:48 PM] Ben Menyala: It’s like intrabank
[17/3/25, 7:48:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hmmm…. I wonder if we can have a chat with PdAX to resolve this ? 
But we will have to think thru what we need from PDAX

[18/3/25, 10:10:48 AM] HengHongLee: this is the refund
[18/3/25, 10:10:58 AM] HengHongLee: they had more to put in sx for the subsequent ones

[18/3/25, 10:18:29 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh damm the amount they sent was $4958
[18/3/25, 10:18:51 AM] HengHongLee: there was another disbursement with it right

[18/3/25, 10:19:03 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh phew
[18/3/25, 10:19:28 AM] Ben Menyala: So I don’t think so
[18/3/25, 10:19:41 AM] HengHongLee: ah okay
[18/3/25, 10:19:48 AM] Ben Menyala: Makes sense ah
[18/3/25, 10:20:01 AM] Ben Menyala: 60 bps there 60 bps back
[18/3/25, 10:20:21 AM] HengHongLee: more than 60 i think
[18/3/25, 10:20:24 AM] Ben Menyala: It’ll be about 120-140 bps
[18/3/25, 10:20:31 AM] HengHongLee: its compounding
[18/3/25, 10:20:43 AM] HengHongLee: or less i think
[18/3/25, 10:23:29 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohya less
[18/3/25, 10:23:50 AM] Ben Menyala: Less php coming bsck
[18/3/25, 10:24:02 AM] HengHongLee: but it is what it is
[18/3/25, 10:24:03 AM] Ben Menyala: Maybe we can have a holding feature
[18/3/25, 10:24:08 AM] Ben Menyala: Wrong account number
[18/3/25, 10:24:16 AM] Ben Menyala: Then we just leave as php
[18/3/25, 10:24:22 AM] Sandra Fortune: Surprise - since php to Sg no demand so rates should be tighter
[18/3/25, 10:24:26 AM] Ben Menyala: Until they come to our dashboard to correct it
[18/3/25, 10:24:56 AM] HengHongLee: but this is usdc to sgd and php to usdc
[18/3/25, 10:29:07 AM] Ben Menyala: Lucky it’s 5k
[18/3/25, 10:29:15 AM] Ben Menyala: Imagine its dazzling 50k
[18/3/25, 10:29:22 AM] Ben Menyala: That’s 1K loss hahahaha
[18/3/25, 10:30:17 AM] Ben Menyala: Think we probably should exhaust all options (like wait for new account number) before we execute refund
[18/3/25, 10:33:55 AM] Ben Menyala: Maybe a page that has 
- Pending transactions 
- ⁠Reason
- ⁠Action - then for eg action will be updating account number, send back to usdc, send back to sgd etc with the estimated cost for each
[18/3/25, 10:34:02 AM] Ben Menyala: Does that make sense
[18/3/25, 10:34:09 AM] Ben Menyala: Cos honestly if we are a tech solution
[18/3/25, 10:34:22 AM] Ben Menyala: We should try to make this self service as possible and leave the decision making back to the client
[18/3/25, 10:40:57 AM] HengHongLee: should we announce in the other chat that ample lost S$92 for this refund?
[18/3/25, 10:41:42 AM] Sandra Fortune: Holy cow  😬 probably we should wait out
[18/3/25, 10:42:12 AM] Sandra Fortune: But definitely something that need to come clean with QY but not to the rest of ample team
[18/3/25, 10:42:57 AM] HengHongLee: to be fair its probably more like $45 each way ‎<This message was edited>
[18/3/25, 10:45:59 AM] HengHongLee: haha should shock them abit
[18/3/25, 10:45:59 AM] Ben Menyala: Think they know already hahaha
[18/3/25, 10:46:03 AM] Ben Menyala: Cos they can calculate
[18/3/25, 10:46:06 AM] Ben Menyala: LOLL
[18/3/25, 10:46:08 AM] Ben Menyala: BRO

[18/3/25, 10:58:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - and refund is whoever who caused the issue will have to pay for the cost
[18/3/25, 10:58:27 AM] Sandra Fortune: So it’s PDAX and SX ?
[18/3/25, 10:59:25 AM] HengHongLee: in this case its actually ample
[18/3/25, 10:59:45 AM] HengHongLee: coz they gave the wrong account number and the first time customer
[18/3/25, 10:59:55 AM] HengHongLee: but need to furthur investigate
[18/3/25, 11:00:26 AM] HengHongLee: anyway folks, im gonna bring the office macmini home so some stuff gonna be down for while today
[18/3/25, 11:01:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: Heh heh
[18/3/25, 11:01:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok.
[18/3/25, 11:01:48 AM] Sandra Fortune: Does it affect txn ? If not, then no need to tell ample to avoid those times
[18/3/25, 11:01:50 AM] HengHongLee: just the metabase and the docs site mainly
[18/3/25, 11:01:55 AM] HengHongLee: nah wont affect ample
[18/3/25, 11:02:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: Need to bring your barang barang back also

‎[18/3/25, 7:43:25 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[18/3/25, 7:44:05 PM] Praise: Wow, that makes sense
[18/3/25, 7:44:37 PM] HengHongLee: and i cleaned up abit so it looks like the refund happened in 1 transaction
[18/3/25, 7:44:56 PM] Praise: btw I’ve been thinking, how do we handle cancelled transactions, but some steps were successful?
[18/3/25, 7:47:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Like halfway?
[18/3/25, 7:47:48 PM] Ben Menyala: Or already refunded?
[18/3/25, 7:48:03 PM] Praise: Yea halfway
[18/3/25, 7:49:15 PM] HengHongLee: yeah its just stops but there are some 2 kinds of cancel
[18/3/25, 7:49:29 PM] HengHongLee: one is alr executed, and the other is haven execute yet
[18/3/25, 7:49:40 PM] HengHongLee: the later is easier, the former need to resolve
[18/3/25, 7:51:57 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya was thinking of this
[18/3/25, 7:52:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me work on the requirements next week when I’m back and we can discuss more
[18/3/25, 7:52:53 PM] Praise: Actually this looks good
[18/3/25, 7:55:32 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya it’s like a triage for failed txns
[18/3/25, 7:58:51 PM] HengHongLee: Failure reasons
1. wrong account number / wrong bank code (could not detect)
2. ⁠wrong account number / wrong bank code (could detect via validation)
3. ⁠rates changed
4. quote expired (straitsx) - refund
5. ⁠travel rule info ⁠(straitsx) - refund
[18/3/25, 7:59:03 PM] HengHongLee: did i miss anything
[18/3/25, 7:59:53 PM] Ben Menyala: RFI is already handled pre txn right
[18/3/25, 8:00:15 PM] HengHongLee: yeah coz all <50k
[18/3/25, 8:00:27 PM] HengHongLee: so RFI doesnt come in to effect yet
[18/3/25, 8:00:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Okkk actly interesting RFI could also be an action
[18/3/25, 8:01:05 PM] Ben Menyala: They see failed then they add the fields
[18/3/25, 8:01:09 PM] Ben Menyala: Then it’ll go through
[18/3/25, 8:01:39 PM] HengHongLee: i dont think so
[18/3/25, 8:01:45 PM] HengHongLee: we already handle it with the schema
[18/3/25, 8:01:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh yeahh true but if it changes or anything
[18/3/25, 8:02:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Or like a new VASP has this error
[18/3/25, 8:02:18 PM] Ben Menyala: Can it be dynamic enough to ask the client to add more fields
[18/3/25, 8:02:19 PM] HengHongLee: then we should change on our side
[18/3/25, 8:02:22 PM] HengHongLee: the schema logic
[18/3/25, 8:02:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Right
[18/3/25, 8:02:49 PM] Ben Menyala: You’re thinking of making it schema specific for each VASP?
[18/3/25, 8:02:56 PM] HengHongLee: it already is
[18/3/25, 8:03:01 PM] Praise: This is how it ois now
[18/3/25, 8:03:51 PM] Praise: But we already make sure they add all required fields before sending
[18/3/25, 8:03:59 PM] Praise: So why we need them to add more fields?
[18/3/25, 8:04:23 PM] HengHongLee: ‎You deleted this message.
[18/3/25, 8:04:55 PM] HengHongLee: 1) we might be able improve with namecheck / pre-send check api 
2) we can fix, still a few things not done yet
3) somewhat mitigated with bps adjustments
[18/3/25, 8:06:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya was just thinking if there’s a scenario where the RFI fails or like the fields change - but yeah we can just update the schema then
[18/3/25, 8:06:39 PM] HengHongLee: yeah our schema can change based off amounts being sent
[18/3/25, 8:06:43 PM] HengHongLee: its v powerful

[19/3/25, 9:55:30 AM] Sandra Fortune: 😬😬😬
[19/3/25, 9:56:49 AM] HengHongLee: for most cases it should be correct
[19/3/25, 9:57:22 AM] HengHongLee: ‎You deleted this message.
[19/3/25, 9:58:36 AM] HengHongLee: basically it currently calculates all bundles starting with sgd but doesnt matter if the individual transactions succeed
[19/3/25, 10:00:41 AM] HengHongLee: so it also counts the refunds as success
[19/3/25, 10:31:31 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh I see. Which shouldn’t be the case actually. 
Hmmm … at least until the point of refund. So the vol is dynamic base on the trigger to refund ? ‎<This message was edited>

[19/3/25, 10:47:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: Nice - I wanted to ask version 2 stands for what Kekekeke
[19/3/25, 10:48:47 AM] HengHongLee: but for this i used a fixed sgd/php rate
[19/3/25, 10:48:50 AM] HengHongLee: which might be wrong
[19/3/25, 10:49:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: You mean when we refund - it’s using fixed rate and not previous or current ?
[19/3/25, 10:49:37 AM] HengHongLee: in our code we always use the current rate for calculations
[19/3/25, 10:50:07 AM] HengHongLee: but for this chart, we get the php amount and we just divide by 42.99 as the rate
[19/3/25, 10:50:31 AM] Sandra Fortune: Actually using current is really usual in fintech - but big schemes - if I don’t recall wrongly, we use rate of that day …
[19/3/25, 10:50:49 AM] HengHongLee: current is correct
[19/3/25, 10:50:54 AM] HengHongLee: our system always uses current
[19/3/25, 10:51:25 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ah using fix rate - I guess it’s ok for now
[19/3/25, 10:51:31 AM] HengHongLee: yes
[19/3/25, 11:02:21 AM] Ben Menyala: Think milind request was to remove the refunds piece on metabase
[19/3/25, 11:02:30 AM] Ben Menyala: So only txns that are successful for ample
[19/3/25, 11:02:41 AM] Ben Menyala: Those failed should not be inside the GMV number @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[19/3/25, 11:04:07 AM] HengHongLee: then the new dashboard v2 should have those
[19/3/25, 11:04:31 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah . When I read it I was thinking - we did it already …
[19/3/25, 11:05:52 AM] Ben Menyala: Yupp
[19/3/25, 11:05:58 AM] Ben Menyala: It’s the same link right
[19/3/25, 11:06:17 AM] HengHongLee: ya
[19/3/25, 11:06:29 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - #2 on PDAX, our clients currently need to sign sworn cert (indicate that they are checking and sending kyc for sender and bene - basic sender KYC duties) 
That one - I’m asking QY to help to sign ‎<This message was edited>
[19/3/25, 11:06:52 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh okay
[19/3/25, 11:07:03 AM] Ben Menyala: But it still requires them to open an account right
[19/3/25, 11:07:27 AM] Sandra Fortune: And for the remit agreement - seems like we got no wiggle room - to me -just sign it - but have manage to push it off till commercial launch
[19/3/25, 11:08:56 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ya. That’s why so many agreement signing required. It’s painful.
Somehow milind and nichel think can do wash account like structure
[19/3/25, 11:09:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: #3 - we haven’t spoke to PDAx about it right ? We want to propose
[19/3/25, 11:21:59 AM] Ben Menyala: LOL I dropped the bomb
[19/3/25, 11:22:12 AM] HengHongLee: also the 50k transaction limit thingy
[19/3/25, 11:22:10 AM] Ben Menyala: Had to be done 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[19/3/25, 11:22:18 AM] HengHongLee: we tried it and it didnt work
[19/3/25, 11:22:27 AM] Ben Menyala: We need to switch to non real time right
[19/3/25, 11:22:39 AM] HengHongLee: but non real time means they use pesonet
[19/3/25, 11:22:46 AM] Ben Menyala: I think the Param is real time so it didn’t work?
[19/3/25, 11:23:05 AM] HengHongLee: we want the instapay and they split for us right
[19/3/25, 11:23:10 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cool. That’s good 
But don’t let him push you around on why we didn’t think about it previously 
We did previously but we didn’t realise that PDAX validation is wonky
[19/3/25, 11:23:52 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha can
[19/3/25, 11:24:58 AM] HengHongLee: yah like the rates changing we alr knew from day one, we just praying wont happen but it happened anyway haha
[19/3/25, 11:25:26 AM] Sandra Fortune: Let’s do a list of asks from
PDAX - consolidate what we want to ask so easier for us to follow up
[19/3/25, 11:27:22 AM] Ben Menyala: 1. PDAX rates whether it can be down to 10-15 bps (also maybe explore tiering like straitsX)
2. ⁠Can PDAX own the account instead of having our client to open it (in the case of instantcash) while we wait for Cebuana / Dragon
3. ⁠Given recent failures in live transaction, can PDAX build a pre-validation api that can help us with name / account check
4. ⁠Increase rate lock to 2 mins
5. ⁠Can pdax help with auto splitting multiple txns to allow for real time >50k fund flow ‎<This message was edited>
[19/3/25, 11:27:34 AM] Ben Menyala: Sandra what’s the contract stuff you can add here
[19/3/25, 11:31:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: This relates to #2.
As account belongs to client (ample) 
They are required to sign Remittance Contract (as client is sending to PdAX’s partners) and Sworn Cert (to confirm that they are doing proper KYC, which is required by BSP). 

I’ve gone thru the agreement - there’s no wiggle room for ample to not sign it since they are leveraging on PDAX’s partners
[19/3/25, 11:33:52 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha for 2. we just need nichal to tell milind the truth
[19/3/25, 11:33:54 AM] Ben Menyala: Lololol
[19/3/25, 11:33:59 AM] Ben Menyala: Then we can say no they can’t do it
[19/3/25, 11:34:08 AM] Ben Menyala: If not milind still hanging on to that thread
[19/3/25, 11:34:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahahahahahah …. Ya
[19/3/25, 11:34:35 AM] Ben Menyala: I put there so he can go ask and then nichal can finally say no
[19/3/25, 11:34:44 AM] Ben Menyala: lol maybe we need to ask kit to tell nichal
[19/3/25, 11:34:49 AM] Ben Menyala: Please tell milind not possible
[19/3/25, 11:34:52 AM] Sandra Fortune: Nichal also dragging it out
[19/3/25, 11:35:06 AM] Sandra Fortune: I’ve already told him the other day ! 
This dude ah
[19/3/25, 11:35:25 AM] Sandra Fortune: You spoke to him already ?
[19/3/25, 11:37:27 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha no
[19/3/25, 11:37:31 AM] Ben Menyala: He never call me yet
[19/3/25, 11:38:19 AM] Sandra Fortune: His in Indon now
[19/3/25, 11:38:58 AM] Sandra Fortune: He ask me if ample can hit 111k 
Base on existing run rate - it’ll hit about $120k … I think 
Let me check on the Josh’s convo - I calculated it then - can hit
[19/3/25, 11:40:12 AM] Ben Menyala: Why 111k
[19/3/25, 11:40:17 AM] Ben Menyala: What a weird number
[19/3/25, 11:40:36 AM] Sandra Fortune: I ask the same question ! 🤣🤣🤣
[19/3/25, 11:40:46 AM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[19/3/25, 11:40:51 AM] Sandra Fortune: Logic is this - at 111k we have annual run rate of 1mm usd gmv
[19/3/25, 11:41:04 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohh
[19/3/25, 11:41:06 AM] Ben Menyala: LOLL

[20/3/25, 8:36:06 AM] Sandra Fortune: Or to ample - cos they are the account holders 
But you guys may be right - maybe not scheduled 
Just maintenance hahhahaha

[20/3/25, 8:36:31 AM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩

[20/3/25, 10:07:48 AM] Sandra Fortune: I haven’t send my notes to milind cos it’s so bad 😬
[20/3/25, 10:15:33 AM] Sandra Fortune: My comments (long!) 

Noel
- Investment experience. Speaking to investors. Have run many start ups and part of many as well.
- Un-engaging. Didn’t seem to be interested to be in the convo
- Didn’t feel good vibes – I felt a little belittled by how he carried himself during the whole conversation.
- At one point of the call, he walked away without saying anything. I was sharing about our business expansion and our learnings.
He was away for a while and all was silent. when he came back – he told me – carry on – no please, no apologies, no accountability of his
disappearance from the call.

Questions (Sandra to Noel)
(1) How do you view clients who are closed off? The ones who frown at Web3—do they end up at the bottom of the barrel?
   + shares that it is dependent on what clients want to hear (red flag - - I would expect to hear challenges rather than what they want to hear)
   + mentions that pre-funding is not as important as speed (his concept is interesting – that’s probably because he works a lot with Emirates and Etihad
       where payment must be received before delivery of parts) h
       hence in his experience, its more delivery then locked up capital/prefunding
         - the ability to approach clients’ painpoints doesn’t seem to be demonstrated through the convo
        - will need to educate Noel on the standard correspondent banking model, since we interface more with folks who holds MPI license or their clients behind.
           (but, I am not 100% sure if he can digest.)
The org genre he deals with and is accustom to may be (or not at all)  Xweave’s next tier of clients to go into (industry/segment base)
    + he shared about “Web3” word – that people are adverse to (so its more EMOTIONS vs KNOWLEDGE).  I like it that he called that out.
        Knowing this should hopefully help him manoeuvre/navigate conversations with client.
(2) What countries his familiar with – doing business in
     + UAE and S.Africa. (Asia/SEA – not so much – but that’s fine for Xweave’s side)
Questions (Noel to Sandra)
+ how the culture of the team is like
+ Challenges the team faced. ‎<This message was edited>

yeah his energy is abit on the low side, i found that he had relevant experience in payment orchestration and was willing to talk more on that, he mentioned onboarding challenges and other issues we have already thought about
[20/3/25, 12:11:17 PM] Sandra Fortune: Interesting… he didn’t come across as understanding issues and challenges
[20/3/25, 12:12:32 PM] Sandra Fortune: I’m wondering now if his style of selling may be different
[20/3/25, 1:21:14 PM] Sandra Fortune: any good news from PDAX that they are up and running ?
[20/3/25, 1:21:20 PM] Sandra Fortune: didn't hear from Andrew
[20/3/25, 1:29:00 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh and also kit declined the meeting later
[20/3/25, 1:29:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Should I cancel it and guess we can set up another one
[20/3/25, 1:29:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Next week
[20/3/25, 1:29:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: actually - my pdax meeting not appearing...hmmm
[20/3/25, 1:29:42 PM] Sandra Fortune: yea - let's cancel it - we probably have more time to work on the flow
[20/3/25, 1:29:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: let's put in for next week - more time for everyone to accept.
[20/3/25, 1:30:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: I'm also going to work with Qy on the remittance contract from PDAX - there's no way we are going to escape getting our clients to sign them. 
But to what extend is Ample able to accept it - one of things to speak about with QY
[20/3/25, 1:31:04 PM] Ben Menyala: I realised it was only to your menyala emails
[20/3/25, 1:31:35 PM] Sandra Fortune: oooh… hahhaha. oppps.
[20/3/25, 1:31:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: i'm going to kill my menyala email addy already.
[20/3/25, 1:37:20 PM] HengHongLee: nope he say haven yet in slack
‎[20/3/25, 1:42:10 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[20/3/25, 3:58:47 PM] HengHongLee: still down leh
[20/3/25, 3:58:51 PM] HengHongLee: 🙁
[20/3/25, 3:59:06 PM] Sandra Fortune: 😬😬😬
[20/3/25, 3:59:10 PM] Praise: Wow
[20/3/25, 3:59:14 PM] HengHongLee: can meh lidat
[20/3/25, 3:59:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: hahaha - win already right..
[20/3/25, 3:59:29 PM] Praise: This is gonna discourage AMPLE
[20/3/25, 3:59:30 PM] Sandra Fortune: how to do business. aiyoh.
[20/3/25, 3:59:43 PM] Praise: How 🥲
[20/3/25, 3:59:48 PM] HengHongLee: thats why need multiple partners
[20/3/25, 3:59:58 PM] HengHongLee: one only proof of concept
[20/3/25, 3:59:58 PM] Sandra Fortune: yeah.... let's speak to Coin PH hahhaha
[20/3/25, 4:00:07 PM] HengHongLee: yah lo
[20/3/25, 4:17:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya omg why down so long
[20/3/25, 4:17:35 PM] Ben Menyala: Plus never reply us
[20/3/25, 4:17:44 PM] HengHongLee: they did reply on slack
[20/3/25, 4:18:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh is it didn’t see let me check
[20/3/25, 4:21:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Shagggg
[20/3/25, 4:22:13 PM] Ben Menyala: Just now Sandra and I were discussing we thought of a way to solve beneficiary check
[20/3/25, 4:23:00 PM] Sandra Fortune: hahhahahah... i thought that solution came out really quite quick hahahha
[20/3/25, 4:25:27 PM] Ben Menyala: So for first time customers (which ample can indicate)

Eg if this customer wants to send $5K, 
we can have a pool of buffer funds in pdax in php (eg $200 worth) to do small amount transfer. So e.g $3 to that account number 

Then if it passes we send the remaining $4997 to the user (but from straitsX still send 5K to top up the $3) , if it fails then it’s fine we won’t lose anything anyway
[20/3/25, 4:45:31 PM] HengHongLee: hmm this is the client own money or our money
[20/3/25, 4:45:43 PM] Ben Menyala: Client money that we ask to put as buffer
[20/3/25, 4:46:35 PM] HengHongLee: technically its possible but feels abit messy
[20/3/25, 4:46:58 PM] Sandra Fortune: we can put that as an operational buffer.
[20/3/25, 4:47:22 PM] Sandra Fortune: so its part of the operating piece. We could probably put SGD$50 or lesser
[20/3/25, 4:47:34 PM] Sandra Fortune: for now - Ample owning the account on PDAX will work.
[20/3/25, 4:47:35 PM] HengHongLee: just send the minimal like 11php
[20/3/25, 4:47:42 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[20/3/25, 4:47:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: yeah.
[20/3/25, 4:47:47 PM] Ben Menyala: We just need to send minimal
[20/3/25, 4:47:59 PM] HengHongLee: so dont need $4997
[20/3/25, 4:48:06 PM] Ben Menyala: But we don’t want the customer to get extra money though
[20/3/25, 4:48:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Damm weird to get like 20 cents then 4999.80
[20/3/25, 4:48:38 PM] Ben Menyala: But actually I think that’s fine haha
[20/3/25, 4:48:50 PM] HengHongLee: then make it 2cents or 1cent
[20/3/25, 4:48:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[20/3/25, 4:48:57 PM] Ben Menyala: Minimal can alr
[20/3/25, 4:49:11 PM] HengHongLee: can send 11php i dont think so
[20/3/25, 4:49:15 PM] HengHongLee: hmm
[20/3/25, 4:49:16 PM] Ben Menyala: The minimum is 11 php?
[20/3/25, 4:49:20 PM] Ben Menyala: Let’s test with inas bank
[20/3/25, 4:49:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Or ewallet
[20/3/25, 4:49:27 PM] HengHongLee: i think still need 200 minimum
[20/3/25, 4:49:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me check
[20/3/25, 4:49:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh
[20/3/25, 4:50:01 PM] HengHongLee: no extra work is needed actually
[20/3/25, 4:50:10 PM] HengHongLee: the product currently is able to do what u are saying
[20/3/25, 4:50:11 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh how come
[20/3/25, 4:50:15 PM] HengHongLee: but its manual
[20/3/25, 4:50:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[20/3/25, 4:50:34 PM] Ben Menyala: But I’m thinking we might need to do productize it
[20/3/25, 4:50:39 PM] Ben Menyala: So it’s automated
[20/3/25, 4:50:42 PM] Ben Menyala: For certain set of txns
[20/3/25, 4:50:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Esp
[20/3/25, 4:50:49 PM] Ben Menyala: High amount txns
[20/3/25, 4:50:59 PM] Ben Menyala: + first timer
[20/3/25, 4:51:44 PM] HengHongLee: dont think needs to be automated ‎<This message was edited>
[20/3/25, 4:52:09 PM] Praise: So we pre validate before actually executing right?
[20/3/25, 4:52:16 PM] Sandra Fortune: it needs to. unless we want ample to tell us client sending first time then we manually send.
[20/3/25, 4:52:24 PM] Praise: pre validate by sendfing feew cents
[20/3/25, 4:52:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya prevalidation in the form of sending few cents
[20/3/25, 4:52:29 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[20/3/25, 4:52:38 PM] Praise: I see Isee. Hmmm
[20/3/25, 4:52:39 PM] Sandra Fortune: yes - for some txn - not all. 
All will be great ! but creating a lot of traffic though
[20/3/25, 4:52:46 PM] Ben Menyala: Lmaoo
[20/3/25, 4:52:51 PM] Ben Menyala: Inflate the numbers
[20/3/25, 4:52:58 PM] Sandra Fortune: hahhahahahahaha.
[20/3/25, 4:53:04 PM] HengHongLee: they already can do it via the swap page
[20/3/25, 4:53:07 PM] Sandra Fortune: BSP will go after PDAX :P
[20/3/25, 4:53:23 PM] Praise: They can but they won’t wanna do for all their txns right
[20/3/25, 4:53:29 PM] Praise: Stress for them too
[20/3/25, 4:54:28 PM] HengHongLee: basically our system alr handles this its just another layer at the very top
[20/3/25, 4:54:54 PM] HengHongLee: and it involves them managing a pdax balance
[20/3/25, 4:55:08 PM] HengHongLee: so imo since they alr managing that pdax balance just do themselves
[20/3/25, 4:55:59 PM] Praise: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ are u saying it is our responsibility to ensure the acc number correct?
[20/3/25, 4:56:26 PM] Praise: We already try to check that the acc number format is right
[20/3/25, 4:57:14 PM] Praise: But I think I get the point because we would have moved the money to pdax before we realise the acc number they provided is wrong
[20/3/25, 4:57:23 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya that’s why
[20/3/25, 4:57:34 PM] Praise: So if we can determine way early, better
[20/3/25, 4:57:35 PM] HengHongLee: yes but whos going to manage the pdax balance
[20/3/25, 4:57:46 PM] Ben Menyala: I think it’s not our responsibility but it’s a value added service that can differentiate us
[20/3/25, 4:57:59 PM] Ben Menyala: I think we can show on the xweave dashboard
[20/3/25, 4:58:08 PM] Ben Menyala: Like we recommend having $100 operational float
[20/3/25, 4:58:17 PM] Ben Menyala: Sth like that
[20/3/25, 4:58:23 PM] Praise: Hmm, kinda messy
[20/3/25, 4:58:24 PM] Praise: haha
[20/3/25, 4:58:25 PM] HengHongLee: then goes against no prefunding marketing
[20/3/25, 4:58:43 PM] HengHongLee: i feel should just recommend them
[20/3/25, 4:58:46 PM] Ben Menyala: Then it’ll just kinda auto refill itself
[20/3/25, 4:58:48 PM] Praise: We then start managing ledger balance for sending cents?
[20/3/25, 4:58:58 PM] HengHongLee: if u want to check and have funds in pdax can just use swap page send $5
[20/3/25, 4:59:09 PM] HengHongLee: later use bundle send amount-$5
[20/3/25, 4:59:26 PM] Ben Menyala: Hmm but if they have 100 txns a day
[20/3/25, 4:59:32 PM] Praise: Customers won’t wanna do that tho. haha
[20/3/25, 4:59:35 PM] HengHongLee: huh how to refill
[20/3/25, 4:59:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Like your $100 there
[20/3/25, 4:59:59 PM] HengHongLee: then u need name check
[20/3/25, 5:00:01 PM] HengHongLee: api
[20/3/25, 5:00:00 PM] Ben Menyala: Say you use 20 cents to validate
[20/3/25, 5:00:06 PM] Ben Menyala: Goes down to 99.80
[20/3/25, 5:00:22 PM] Ben Menyala: Then the txn goes through you top it back up to 100 ‎<This message was edited>
[20/3/25, 5:00:30 PM] Ben Menyala: So it’ll always remain there as $100
[20/3/25, 5:01:01 PM] HengHongLee: what about the 10php cost
[20/3/25, 5:01:15 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh yeahh fair
[20/3/25, 5:01:27 PM] Ben Menyala: So it’ll be extra 10 php for validation check
[20/3/25, 5:01:40 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe we can charge extra $0.50 per txn
[20/3/25, 5:01:47 PM] Ben Menyala: For this kind of validation check
[20/3/25, 5:01:51 PM] Ben Menyala: Cos I would assume big amounts
[20/3/25, 5:01:57 PM] Ben Menyala: It’ll be worth it
[20/3/25, 5:02:05 PM] Ben Menyala: Don’t wanna waste $100 for a 5K txn
[20/3/25, 5:04:37 PM] HengHongLee: our system doesnt really have alot of fixed costs
[20/3/25, 5:04:38 PM] Sandra Fortune: for validation checks - PDAX shouldn't charge us - or can we negotiate that
[20/3/25, 5:05:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya maybe we can ask them
[20/3/25, 5:05:51 PM] Ben Menyala: In the next meeting
[20/3/25, 5:05:54 PM] Ben Menyala: How to implement this
[20/3/25, 5:05:57 PM] Ben Menyala: If we want
[20/3/25, 5:06:11 PM] Sandra Fortune: yeah.
[20/3/25, 5:06:16 PM] HengHongLee: they can just send 1cent from their side
[20/3/25, 5:06:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[20/3/25, 5:06:42 PM] HengHongLee: but for sure got namecheck from gcash or paymaya
[20/3/25, 5:06:47 PM] Ben Menyala: If limit is not on wallet side
[20/3/25, 5:06:49 PM] HengHongLee: they just need to implement
[20/3/25, 5:07:16 PM] Sandra Fortune: its not our responsibility on validating KYC - but if we could help remove the chance of a rejection which cost client $100 as oppose to traditional flow of $20 cost - i think we should solutionize a pre-validation in our solution
[20/3/25, 5:08:44 PM] HengHongLee: imo before proper PMF dont need worry bout this $100
[20/3/25, 5:09:57 PM] HengHongLee: should spend time on more integrations and cheaper rates
[20/3/25, 5:10:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: while we are waiting for more integration we can think about this .. 🤭
[20/3/25, 5:11:09 PM] HengHongLee: also the wrong account number wouldnt have passed the new validation. it had a 0xxxx instead of a 63xxx ‎<This message was edited>
[20/3/25, 5:13:45 PM] Sandra Fortune: so question is - how can we help client avoid that high cost of refund ?
Maybe move $1 to test first ? 
But that means it is a full journey from SGD to PHP as a test. 
Base on the flow from PDAX out to test - it short circuit the process to achieve pre-validation
[20/3/25, 5:15:51 PM] HengHongLee: you also cannot solve the fact if they send to a wrong number
[20/3/25, 5:16:50 PM] HengHongLee: imo the validation is already enough and would have caught this issue already
[20/3/25, 5:17:01 PM] HengHongLee: i suggest we just front this $100 and wait for next occurance
[20/3/25, 5:17:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: 😬
[20/3/25, 5:18:06 PM] Sandra Fortune: I'll discuss this with QY.
[20/3/25, 5:18:39 PM] HengHongLee: you can think of it as we didnt validate it properly yet thats why they managed to send it through
[20/3/25, 5:19:30 PM] Praise: Actually for the last case of the refund our validation won’t have caught it
[20/3/25, 5:19:45 PM] Praise: Because the format was correct
[20/3/25, 5:20:01 PM] HengHongLee: what was the details
[20/3/25, 5:20:45 PM] Praise: The details of what?
[20/3/25, 5:20:53 PM] HengHongLee: of the send

[20/3/25, 5:23:43 PM] Praise: Yes
[20/3/25, 5:24:43 PM] HengHongLee: ah ok
[20/3/25, 5:24:55 PM] HengHongLee: i stand corrected
[20/3/25, 5:25:04 PM] HengHongLee: also if you wanted to build this, you could build it just in time
[20/3/25, 5:25:15 PM] HengHongLee: since there are not many fixed fees
[20/3/25, 5:28:28 PM] Sandra Fortune: how does that work.
[20/3/25, 5:29:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Haha okay we discuss more next week and whiteboard it
[20/3/25, 5:37:21 PM] HengHongLee: basically u swap and send the pilot transaction if i succeed then the rest get swap and send... ah but moving rates ‎<This message was edited>
[20/3/25, 5:40:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: but then we kana all the rates and fees.
[20/3/25, 5:40:33 PM] HengHongLee: the rates and fees are % so it doesnt matter
[20/3/25, 5:40:57 PM] Sandra Fortune: how about min. amount.
[20/3/25, 5:41:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: currently now is $10?
[20/3/25, 5:41:48 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya if rate lock longer I think can

[20/3/25, 6:19:00 PM] Ben Menyala: Looks like a bug somewhere
[20/3/25, 6:19:14 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe in your excel sheet
[20/3/25, 6:20:15 PM] Sandra Fortune: HEY !

[20/3/25, 6:26:06 PM] Sandra Fortune: ya !
[20/3/25, 6:26:15 PM] Ben Menyala: How is that possible
[20/3/25, 6:26:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Lolol
[20/3/25, 6:26:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: so we've used up about $357.62 of subsidy
[20/3/25, 6:26:34 PM] Ben Menyala: The rate never seen before one
[20/3/25, 6:26:44 PM] Ben Menyala: This rate doesn’t make sense to me
[20/3/25, 6:26:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: hahah.. .our xweave rate is waaaay below mid market
[20/3/25, 6:26:52 PM] Ben Menyala: It’s usually in the 43/44 range
[20/3/25, 6:27:15 PM] Sandra Fortune: ya ! this few ones are outliers..
[20/3/25, 6:27:45 PM] Sandra Fortune: i was doing the math on subsidy - and saw these from the downloaded data.
[20/3/25, 6:42:23 PM] HengHongLee: one looks like usd/php the other looks like sgd/php
[20/3/25, 6:43:04 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ probably should fix this
[20/3/25, 6:44:16 PM] Praise: Haha, definetely a bug

[20/3/25, 7:06:52 PM] Sandra Fortune: its the 27th Feb
[20/3/25, 7:10:41 PM] Praise: Actually it’s only transactions that happened on that day havinbg this issue. Looks more like a data issue than logic issue
[20/3/25, 7:10:56 PM] HengHongLee: hmmmm
[20/3/25, 7:11:04 PM] Praise: Maybe we manually did something that day?
[20/3/25, 7:11:50 PM] HengHongLee: when was this?

[20/3/25, 11:30:40 PM] Ben Menyala: But im heading mixed responses on whether they are really giving the 20 bps they promised

[21/3/25, 12:24:42 AM] HengHongLee: https://learn.pdax.ph/post/usdg-on-solana-is-now-on-pdax

[21/3/25, 12:25:55 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya that’s sad ‎<This message was edited>
[21/3/25, 12:26:01 AM] Ben Menyala: It’s okay
[21/3/25, 12:26:06 AM] Ben Menyala: We ask paxos
[21/3/25, 12:26:08 AM] HengHongLee: coz straitsx anti solana
[21/3/25, 12:26:09 AM] HengHongLee: haha
[21/3/25, 12:26:11 AM] Ben Menyala: Make us an on-ramp
[21/3/25, 12:26:11 AM] Praise: Cuz stx doesn’t support solana
[21/3/25, 12:26:18 AM] Praise: Ya
[21/3/25, 8:10:24 AM] Sandra Fortune: The stx fee structure is nonsense
[21/3/25, 8:14:33 AM] Sandra Fortune: Even if it’s 18bps it’s 30plus bps 🤨
[21/3/25, 8:53:20 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - if dazzling send $10k as a single txn how does our system handle it ?  I recall seeing that you guys have resolve the add on RFI for above 50k php. Has it been resolved or I’m reading wrongly hahaha
[21/3/25, 9:02:50 AM] Ben Menyala: It’s T+1
[21/3/25, 9:03:11 AM] Ben Menyala: If real time we need to split txns manually
[21/3/25, 9:03:19 AM] Ben Menyala: But this one haven’t test yet
[21/3/25, 9:04:20 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Because I’m thinking about dazzling 
To get out of 20bps to 15bps - we need at least 10 txn from dazzling
[21/3/25, 9:29:37 AM] HengHongLee: seems like deposits are back up
[21/3/25, 9:29:42 AM] HengHongLee: and sending
[21/3/25, 9:29:55 AM] Ben Menyala: No more fud
[21/3/25, 9:29:55 AM] HengHongLee: let me withdraw our money first hahah
[21/3/25, 9:35:48 AM] HengHongLee: alright we got our money out
[21/3/25, 9:35:50 AM] HengHongLee: seems safu
[21/3/25, 9:35:59 AM] HengHongLee: can turn ample back on
[21/3/25, 9:36:42 AM] Sandra Fortune: so its up already
[21/3/25, 9:36:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: probably putting solana in - broke something
[21/3/25, 9:41:25 AM] HengHongLee: hahah
[21/3/25, 9:41:36 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ causing mayhem with all the hack FUD
[21/3/25, 9:41:45 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ do you know what FUD means?
[21/3/25, 9:41:56 AM] HengHongLee: ok pdax working lets tell ample they can send liao

[21/3/25, 9:48:53 AM] Sandra Fortune: whats that Fear ?
[21/3/25, 9:49:14 AM] HengHongLee: Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt
[21/3/25, 9:49:30 AM] Sandra Fortune: ah.. hahaha
[21/3/25, 9:51:03 AM] HengHongLee: we should try to figure out how to encourage ample to use the deposit-to-send feature
[21/3/25, 9:51:17 AM] HengHongLee: deposit exact amount via FAST and it sends
[21/3/25, 9:51:32 AM] HengHongLee: but this means got time lag, means got risk of rates change
[21/3/25, 9:51:47 AM] HengHongLee: but right now we have an adjustable rates increase

[24/3/25, 9:43:24 AM] HengHongLee: need to ask straitsx
[24/3/25, 9:43:50 AM] HengHongLee: yes that means we got a response from them for the sending instruction but haven got the callback
[24/3/25, 9:44:15 AM] HengHongLee: but it also could mean that they sent it and they didnt send us a callback
[24/3/25, 9:44:21 AM] HengHongLee: but seems like its the former i just checked
[24/3/25, 9:45:15 AM] Sandra Fortune: Who didn’t send call back ? Straits X ?

[24/3/25, 3:57:27 PM] Ben Menyala: to < 1K
[24/3/25, 3:57:38 PM] Ben Menyala: but if dazzling comes in with a 25k txn

[25/3/25, 6:34:15 PM] Ben Menyala: Apparently there are some Esports competiton company that pay out to their participants
[25/3/25, 6:34:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Like a few grand as winnings

[25/3/25, 7:43:53 PM] Ben Menyala: We swapped from xsgd to usdc?
[25/3/25, 7:44:04 PM] Praise: 900 usdc, 1.2k sgd
[25/3/25, 7:44:12 PM] Praise: Ya
[25/3/25, 7:44:38 PM] Ben Menyala: Oops I think everytime we do such a txn we need to have 2 people
[25/3/25, 7:44:47 PM] Ben Menyala: I almost did that that time too
[25/3/25, 7:44:54 PM] Ben Menyala: Let me get back and explain to ample
[25/3/25, 7:47:01 PM] Ben Menyala: They have 1.2K lying around in their straitsX account?
[25/3/25, 7:50:30 PM] Praise: They wanted to do some huge txn today
[25/3/25, 7:52:59 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Ben and I spoke. We will tell ample on the group chat 
Option  1 is to white glove txn thru so no cost incurred 
Option 2 : we will take the refund cost ‎<This message was edited>
[25/3/25, 7:53:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: And we are ready to stand by to jump into a call
[25/3/25, 7:53:58 PM] Praise: Hmm I think they would be more bothered about how we could easily spend their funds?
[25/3/25, 7:54:20 PM] Sandra Fortune: We will say it’s an error on our end
[25/3/25, 8:01:52 PM] Praise: Thanks guys. 🫡
[25/3/25, 8:04:19 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahha think we’ll need rbac next
[25/3/25, 8:04:38 PM] Praise: Right
[25/3/25, 8:04:50 PM] Praise: We have that tho, but not completely implemented
[25/3/25, 8:05:02 PM] Praise: Can work on that
[25/3/25, 8:05:09 PM] Ben Menyala: I’m still not home maybe if Heng hong is back after bundle is deleted we trigger the send back to sgd?
[25/3/25, 8:05:23 PM] Praise: Yea we wait for him
[25/3/25, 8:05:24 PM] Ben Menyala: And then we note the difference and let them know the shortfall
[25/3/25, 8:05:26 PM] Ben Menyala: Okay
[25/3/25, 8:06:15 PM] Sandra Fortune: 👍
[25/3/25, 9:52:17 PM] HengHongLee: ok im back sorry bout the delay
[25/3/25, 9:52:27 PM] HengHongLee: so i delete the bundle and the payments?

[25/3/25, 9:53:41 PM] Praise: Yes
[25/3/25, 9:53:50 PM] HengHongLee: ok let me take a look at whats the current state
[25/3/25, 9:53:53 PM] Ben Menyala: ok
[25/3/25, 9:54:13 PM] Praise: The last step was it moving the usdc to pdax
[25/3/25, 9:54:30 PM] HengHongLee: it already went to usdc pdax ah
[25/3/25, 9:54:56 PM] Ben Menyala: tldr we need to
i) Move USDC back to SGD
ii) Check how much SGD 
iii) See what's the shortfall , and then let them know we'll be eating that cost
[25/3/25, 9:55:00 PM] HengHongLee: that means when it comes back to ample straitsx it might need the travel rule RFI which they need to do on their straitsx dashboard
[25/3/25, 9:55:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh ya
[25/3/25, 9:55:19 PM] Ben Menyala: its okay we let QY know

[26/3/25, 10:07:43 AM] Ben Menyala: Or maybe pdax got liquidity issues
[26/3/25, 10:07:58 AM] Ben Menyala: Too many people buying up their usdc to invest
[26/3/25, 10:07:58 AM] HengHongLee: maybe same as straitsx
[26/3/25, 10:08:08 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya where is this surge coming from

[26/3/25, 10:08:16 AM] HengHongLee: all these hard to do rebalancing issues
[26/3/25, 10:08:31 AM] HengHongLee: they need orchestration for rebalancing
[26/3/25, 10:08:45 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahha they also should use temporal
[26/3/25, 10:08:59 AM] HengHongLee: i already told them to in 2019
[26/3/25, 10:09:02 AM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣

[26/3/25, 10:29:00 AM] HengHongLee: i think pdax changed their usdc pol withdrawal fee
[26/3/25, 10:29:04 AM] HengHongLee: from 1usd to 2usd
[26/3/25, 10:29:21 AM] Sandra Fortune: eh - they any how put in charges.

[26/3/25, 11:04:08 AM] Ben Menyala: 1. 1. PDAX rates whether it can be down to 10-15 bps (also maybe explore tiering like straitsX)
2. ⁠Can PDAX own the account instead of having our client to open it (in the case of instantcash) while we wait for Cebuana / Dragon
3. ⁠Given recent failures in live transaction, can PDAX build a pre-validation api that can help us with name / account check
4. ⁠Increase rate lock to 2 mins
5. ⁠Can pdax help with auto splitting multiple txns to allow for real time >50k fund flow
6. usd to 2 usd charge should be applied to ample 
7. Validation of account numbers + sample account numbers
8. Validation using penny test and possibly waiving disbursement charge
[26/3/25, 11:06:59 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh yes … thanks for refreshing this. I completely forgotten about it 😬
[26/3/25, 11:07:56 AM] Sandra Fortune: Contracts side - no wiggle room - will get dazzling and ample to sign it. 
I’ll share that part Kekekek
[26/3/25, 11:08:39 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha oh ya and this

[26/3/25, 11:09:02 AM] Sandra Fortune: The SaSS model .. if we base on flat fee of 0.50 and charge $1k a month - how many txn count will it be ?
[26/3/25, 11:09:08 AM] HengHongLee: can you add the usd withdrawal fee
[26/3/25, 11:11:12 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oh ya - and we are meeting Matt on Thursday instead of Friday 
Think he feels bad for leaving QY out hahhahaha
[26/3/25, 11:22:55 AM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣
[26/3/25, 11:27:16 AM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ @⁨Praise⁩ we got the api keys for independent reserve from Ample haha i forwarded to you guys
[26/3/25, 11:29:06 AM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩ - later I’ll take a look at this. 
But he wants to check for 30 bps ?
[26/3/25, 11:29:45 AM] Ben Menyala: Lower on priority, think level of priority is 
1. Refund flow / increase txn success with validation (we need to wait for pdax to give us all the account number samples) 
2. ⁠RD API integration
3. ⁠Mobee API integration 
4. ⁠IR sgd integration (low priority)
[26/3/25, 11:30:06 AM] Ben Menyala: I’ll update this as epics on Jira
[26/3/25, 11:30:20 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahha 2K txns?

[26/3/25, 6:58:29 PM] Praise: I think because of this
[26/3/25, 7:01:48 PM] HengHongLee: what is this
[26/3/25, 7:02:14 PM] Praise: The transaction that happened on the 27th that probably caused this rate issue
[26/3/25, 7:03:51 PM] HengHongLee: 27th is which transactions
[26/3/25, 7:04:21 PM] Praise: 27 of Feb. I think we did some manual things that affected the rate difference calculation
[26/3/25, 7:04:44 PM] HengHongLee: k i se later
[26/3/25, 7:04:55 PM] Praise: Thanks
[26/3/25, 7:06:36 PM] Praise: So these mobee guys would open our sg -> Indo path right?
[26/3/25, 7:13:41 PM] HengHongLee: yeah

[26/3/25, 7:17:00 PM] Ben Menyala: Yepp! And also UAE Indo

[26/3/25, 7:42:41 PM] Sandra Fortune: Milind asking why not added into GMV
[26/3/25, 7:44:59 PM] Ben Menyala: This isn’t disbursed?
[26/3/25, 7:45:23 PM] Sandra Fortune: Wait this is correction … I just manage to see the yellow label coming up
[26/3/25, 7:45:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Yehh
[26/3/25, 7:45:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: Why correction is 10k
[26/3/25, 7:45:52 PM] Ben Menyala: This one I’m not sure
[26/3/25, 7:45:59 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahaha
[26/3/25, 7:46:00 PM] Ben Menyala: Need ask @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[26/3/25, 7:46:18 PM] Ben Menyala: Think just balancing the straitsX ledger
[26/3/25, 7:46:31 PM] Praise: What 10k is that?
[26/3/25, 7:46:32 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oh. But so much ?
So it’s not a true disbursement
[26/3/25, 7:48:36 PM] Praise: We didn’t do 10k tho?
[26/3/25, 7:48:40 PM] Praise: where it came from?
[26/3/25, 7:49:13 PM] Praise: Oh I see what u mena
[26/3/25, 7:49:19 PM] Praise: that is a correction txn
[26/3/25, 7:50:59 PM] Sandra Fortune: Correction txn from where ? 
It’s the one stuck in PDAX
[26/3/25, 7:51:18 PM] Praise: No it is a top up to straitsx
[26/3/25, 7:51:29 PM] Praise: since ample doesn’t use our platform to fund their stx
[26/3/25, 7:51:37 PM] Praise: we manually create a txn for them
[26/3/25, 7:51:49 PM] Praise: For the initial balance they use
[26/3/25, 7:51:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Yehh
[26/3/25, 7:52:14 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ah
[26/3/25, 7:52:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: This is from PDAx into SX ?
[26/3/25, 7:52:37 PM] Praise: More of SGbank to stx
[26/3/25, 7:52:42 PM] Praise: not pdax related
[26/3/25, 7:52:49 PM] Ben Menyala: Actually maybe we should have the correction txns filtered out so they don’t get confused
[26/3/25, 7:52:55 PM] Ben Menyala: Like keep it there
[26/3/25, 7:53:05 PM] Ben Menyala: But the default page it’s unchecked in the filter
[26/3/25, 7:53:08 PM] Praise: Yes when viewing the page @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ just choose transaction
[26/3/25, 7:53:18 PM] Praise: don’t extract correction txns
[26/3/25, 7:53:39 PM] HengHongLee: ur screen too small @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩
[26/3/25, 7:53:48 PM] HengHongLee: u need the one u have in the office
[26/3/25, 7:53:58 PM] Praise: Yeaaaa
[26/3/25, 7:54:02 PM] Praise: so can see everything
[26/3/25, 7:54:03 PM] Praise: haha
[26/3/25, 7:56:27 PM] Ben Menyala: I know why cos milind check on his phone
‎[26/3/25, 7:56:40 PM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[26/3/25, 7:56:42 PM] Ben Menyala: Then he see this he damm happy
[26/3/25, 7:56:44 PM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[26/3/25, 7:56:48 PM] Ben Menyala: Then check metabase it’s not there
[26/3/25, 8:00:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: I know right ! Hahhahaha
[26/3/25, 8:01:25 PM] Sandra Fortune: It’s me …. He got nothing better to do - so went to check the GMT screen on refresh mode
[26/3/25, 8:02:30 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yes !!! 
Actually it’s me ! I was so happy - thought QY send the esport venue booking thru us and when milind ask me I when to brag to him that ample good client - should believe in them
[26/3/25, 8:02:33 PM] Sandra Fortune: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[26/3/25, 8:02:57 PM] Sandra Fortune: Milind has trust issues with ample … 
Hahha - I was too eager to prove him wrong hahhaha
[26/3/25, 8:07:12 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaahha
[26/3/25, 8:10:47 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha boss say correction too confusing — maybe we use “ledger update” or “top up”? But “top up” technically isn’t correct cos they may top up more but if they never use the number will be wrong
[26/3/25, 8:11:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe we should just filter it out in the default filter settings
[26/3/25, 8:11:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah … agree with you Ben - let’s not use top up
[26/3/25, 9:16:38 PM] Sandra Fortune: https://financialit.net/blog/digitalassets-crypto-blockchain/miles-digital-assets
[26/3/25, 11:13:46 PM] HengHongLee: what do we need to fix
[26/3/25, 11:13:53 PM] HengHongLee: i think it looks correct
[26/3/25, 11:14:23 PM] HengHongLee: except the rates
[26/3/25, 11:14:44 PM] HengHongLee: it looks like got counted as usd to php instead of sgd to php
[26/3/25, 11:48:59 PM] HengHongLee: ok i found out why
[26/3/25, 11:50:37 PM] HengHongLee: this was one of the first few bundles to screw up. 
i created new orders and attached the new orders to the bundle 
but i didnt remove the failed old orders, the bundle calculation system takes into account all the quotes in the bundle, regardless of their order status. so it summed up all the destination amounts and therefore we got a “better” rate
[26/3/25, 11:51:11 PM] HengHongLee: moral of the story, remove the failed bundle orders/quotes/items from the original bundle after creating new ones dont need to leave the cancelled ones there ‎<This message was edited>
[26/3/25, 11:51:46 PM] HengHongLee: its fixed now, they can check again
[27/3/25, 12:04:56 AM] Praise: Oh. Thanks @⁨HengHongLee⁩ I just got back home
[27/3/25, 12:05:27 AM] Praise: Ah I see
[27/3/25, 12:05:50 AM] Praise: Hmmm. Or can we consider this in the calculation
[27/3/25, 12:06:01 AM] Praise: Haha. Nice moral lesson 😂
[27/3/25, 12:09:42 AM] HengHongLee: might need to think abit more about this one, there is some value in having quotes that are progressing or not started be included
[27/3/25, 12:10:04 AM] HengHongLee: cancelled maybe not, but then the cancelled ones will have wierd values ‎<This message was edited>
[27/3/25, 12:10:37 AM] HengHongLee: its better to just dissociate the cancelled ones from the bundle and have them be just cancelled swaps
[27/3/25, 12:10:39 AM] Praise: Hmmm. Right
[27/3/25, 12:10:40 AM] HengHongLee: i think
[27/3/25, 12:10:51 AM] Praise: Ok that makes sense
[27/3/25, 12:10:58 AM] Praise: And this is like an anomaly actually
[27/3/25, 12:11:17 AM] HengHongLee: yeah just dont include failed / cancelled ones into the bundle with the replacements
[27/3/25, 12:11:55 AM] HengHongLee: definitely an anomaly our system is usually perfect🤣
[27/3/25, 12:12:29 AM] Praise: 🙂🙂🙂. Haha I won’t say perfect tho 😂😂😂
[27/3/25, 9:09:40 AM] HengHongLee: anyway straitsx now has the account statement api
[27/3/25, 9:09:59 AM] HengHongLee: we can poll it to fix some of our issues like no deposit notification / no receive notification
[27/3/25, 9:10:12 AM] Ben Menyala: ohhhh finally!
[27/3/25, 9:10:27 AM] HengHongLee: every 15min we can poll for topups and create them automatically
[27/3/25, 9:10:30 AM] Ben Menyala: wait then can we use that to update our balance in the swap page
[27/3/25, 9:10:32 AM] Ben Menyala: nice
[27/3/25, 9:10:36 AM] HengHongLee: but they will still be topups
[27/3/25, 9:10:45 AM] HengHongLee: however you want to name them
[27/3/25, 9:10:56 AM] Ben Menyala: ya makes sense then if we don't have to manually edit, we can call them top ups
[27/3/25, 9:11:05 AM] Ben Menyala: and the numbers will be accurate
[27/3/25, 9:11:07 AM] HengHongLee: topup type?
[27/3/25, 9:11:13 AM] HengHongLee: or?
[27/3/25, 9:11:25 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya instead of correction, let's do "Top up"
[27/3/25, 9:11:30 AM] HengHongLee: ok
[27/3/25, 9:11:36 AM] Ben Menyala: thanks!

[28/3/25, 9:57:51 AM] HengHongLee: but ur penny also need to account
[28/3/25, 9:57:53 AM] HengHongLee: lol
[28/3/25, 9:58:30 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya some complex math needed
[28/3/25, 9:58:39 AM] Ben Menyala: But I think can
[28/3/25, 9:58:49 AM] HengHongLee: hmm let me discuss with praise
[28/3/25, 9:58:53 AM] Ben Menyala: Ok can
‎[28/3/25, 10:00:59 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[28/3/25, 10:02:07 AM] Ben Menyala: like e.g. if this is failed and 646.42 is sent using at 54.4 bps
Then say a next txn comes in at $1000 at 60 bps, 
Then we need to make it such that 646.42 is at 54.4 bps and 353.58 is at 60 bps and then get the new bps for that txn
[28/3/25, 10:02:10 AM] Ben Menyala: is that even possible
[28/3/25, 10:03:17 AM] HengHongLee: exactly 🤣
[28/3/25, 10:03:40 AM] Ben Menyala: hahahaha
[28/3/25, 10:04:56 AM] HengHongLee: haha tell them we need some time
[28/3/25, 10:05:12 AM] Ben Menyala: hahaha ya okay
[28/3/25, 10:05:22 AM] Ben Menyala: say we leave the php there first?
[28/3/25, 10:05:27 AM] Ben Menyala: until we figure out how to do it?
[28/3/25, 10:05:28 AM] HengHongLee: risk keeping in pdax first
[28/3/25, 10:05:32 AM] HengHongLee: hahaha
[28/3/25, 10:05:32 AM] Ben Menyala: can can
[28/3/25, 10:09:03 AM] Ben Menyala: hopefully pdax don't fud
[28/3/25, 10:09:05 AM] Ben Menyala: hahahaha
[28/3/25, 10:09:15 AM] Ben Menyala: but okay la not a lot of money lolol
[28/3/25, 10:15:50 AM] HengHongLee: think the easiest way is to add one more layer before the processing of the bundle. find some transactions to execute with the old bundle's money and add those orders to that old bundle ‎<This message was edited>
[28/3/25, 10:16:17 AM] HengHongLee: as if they were executed with that bundle but late
[28/3/25, 10:16:29 AM] Ben Menyala: right
[28/3/25, 10:17:43 AM] Ben Menyala: but depending on the slight fluctuations of the exchange rate
[28/3/25, 10:18:04 AM] Ben Menyala: actually wait
[28/3/25, 10:18:33 AM] Ben Menyala: makes sense it takes that into account and then only after calculate the exchange rate in the bundle?
[28/3/25, 10:19:17 AM] Ben Menyala: so let's say 1K txn comes in, we only get the rate for $353.58 ?
[28/3/25, 10:19:29 AM] Ben Menyala: hahaah does that make sense lolol
[28/3/25, 10:21:22 AM] HengHongLee: no we never break a txn into two
[28/3/25, 10:21:46 AM] HengHongLee: we just take the smaller txns with amts less than the amount we have in pdax
[28/3/25, 10:21:58 AM] Ben Menyala: Ohhh
[28/3/25, 10:22:10 AM] Ben Menyala: And then just use that bps right
[28/3/25, 10:22:14 AM] Ben Menyala: Ya that’s cleaner
[28/3/25, 10:22:18 AM] HengHongLee: use the old bps
[28/3/25, 10:22:25 AM] Ben Menyala: That’s smart
[28/3/25, 10:22:31 AM] Ben Menyala: Makes sense
[28/3/25, 10:23:37 AM] Ben Menyala: Only issue is let’s say we use up until left 20 bucks
[28/3/25, 10:23:42 AM] Ben Menyala: And no txn is less than 20 bucks
[28/3/25, 10:23:47 AM] Ben Menyala: Then there’ll be 20 bucks stranded there
[28/3/25, 10:23:56 AM] HengHongLee: can just force one <20 bucks txn in the bundle
[28/3/25, 10:24:13 AM] HengHongLee: its possible to break the transaction into two, but i rather ample do it themselves for now
[28/3/25, 10:24:24 AM] Ben Menyala: Yup I agree
[28/3/25, 10:24:30 AM] HengHongLee: because they need to generate a new refID for it ‎<This message was edited>
[28/3/25, 10:24:48 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay I think this makes sense
[28/3/25, 10:43:24 AM] Ben Menyala: Possible to do the refund back to SGD then you guys absorb the $11ish?
[28/3/25, 10:43:42 AM] Ben Menyala: From QY hahaha @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ your call
[28/3/25, 10:44:38 AM] Sandra Fortune: Think have to. No choice 
This time round - whose fault ah
[28/3/25, 10:45:01 AM] Ben Menyala: It should be their fault customer give wrong number
[28/3/25, 10:45:13 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ok la - he already give me 30bps with no subsidy
[28/3/25, 10:45:26 AM] Ben Menyala: But we don’t have mechanism to do drawdown from pdax yet
[28/3/25, 10:45:32 AM] Sandra Fortune: Sorry - I’m slow to respond - at the doc’s
[28/3/25, 10:45:50 AM] Sandra Fortune: My babies pass their flu bug to me - last one in the house to catch it
[28/3/25, 10:46:51 AM] Sandra Fortune: We need to keep refund to minimal - cant take too much cost on that
[28/3/25, 10:48:43 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha yeahh
[28/3/25, 10:48:55 AM] Ben Menyala: That’s like 10 txn worth
[28/3/25, 10:49:00 AM] Ben Menyala: For that refund
[28/3/25, 10:49:02 AM] Ben Menyala: 😬
[28/3/25, 10:49:36 AM] HengHongLee: so i refund?
[28/3/25, 10:49:43 AM] Ben Menyala: ya
[28/3/25, 10:52:40 AM] Ben Menyala: Take care!
[28/3/25, 10:52:41 AM] HengHongLee: ok need QY go in to fill up travel rule RFI
[28/3/25, 10:52:45 AM] Ben Menyala: Okay can
[28/3/25, 10:53:36 AM] Sandra Fortune: Ya man. Crazy leh
[28/3/25, 10:53:58 AM] Sandra Fortune: Think for this - really need to state that client must take on cost already
[28/3/25, 10:54:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: So now - complete urgency to solve for refund
[28/3/25, 10:55:11 AM] Sandra Fortune: If milind - kaopei - tell him : Sandra say so. Unless he wants to fund from his own pocket then he has the right to say anything
[28/3/25, 10:55:48 AM] HengHongLee: ```

[28/3/25, 10:56:10 AM] HengHongLee: should recv 476.64
[28/3/25, 10:56:14 AM] HengHongLee: he recved 476.14
[28/3/25, 10:56:26 AM] HengHongLee: sent $478.14

‎[28/3/25, 10:59:19 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[28/3/25, 10:59:37 AM] Ben Menyala: okay nice thankss
[28/3/25, 10:59:46 AM] HengHongLee: $476.14 is before straitsx took their $0.5
[28/3/25, 11:00:00 AM] HengHongLee: so i think pdax took $2.50
[28/3/25, 11:00:07 AM] HengHongLee: somehow
[28/3/25, 11:04:24 AM] Sandra Fortune: Asssholes hahahaha
[28/3/25, 11:08:00 AM] Ben Menyala: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ where can i see the usdc that was used to convert to php ah? i trying to breakdown the cost
‎[28/3/25, 11:08:03 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[28/3/25, 11:08:37 AM] HengHongLee: this?
[28/3/25, 11:08:20 AM] Ben Menyala: how much USDC was used to get 27518? i can see this in metabase?
[28/3/25, 11:09:09 AM] HengHongLee: u can see that from the cancelled txn on ample page
[28/3/25, 11:09:09 AM] Ben Menyala: ohh i mean the USDC --> PHP flow
[28/3/25, 11:09:23 AM] HengHongLee: see the bundle
[28/3/25, 11:09:31 AM] Ben Menyala: how much USDC was used to get the PHP
[28/3/25, 11:09:38 AM] Ben Menyala: so i can see how much we lose on fx on the way back
‎[28/3/25, 11:10:22 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[28/3/25, 11:10:28 AM] Ben Menyala: it doesn't show the USDC amt tho
[28/3/25, 11:10:57 AM] HengHongLee: need to calculate yourself
[28/3/25, 11:11:02 AM] Ben Menyala: hahahahaha
[28/3/25, 11:11:10 AM] Ben Menyala: in metabase don't have ah
[28/3/25, 11:11:16 AM] Ben Menyala: the usdc that was received in pdax
[28/3/25, 11:11:18 AM] HengHongLee: it's some what calculated in the transactions page
[28/3/25, 11:11:43 AM] HengHongLee: it's batched
[28/3/25, 11:11:59 AM] HengHongLee: so you need to divide it by amount
[28/3/25, 11:12:50 AM] HengHongLee: you can check the external quote of the batch order
[28/3/25, 11:15:00 AM] Ben Menyala: okay can
‎[28/3/25, 1:59:37 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[28/3/25, 1:59:41 PM] HengHongLee: 2 days later it failed haha
[28/3/25, 2:07:21 PM] Sandra Fortune: so here's the things we need to fix. this is ops - unfortunately, our partners tell us - just return loh - but cost wise - its jiat lat.
[28/3/25, 2:11:18 PM] Sandra Fortune: guys, dazzling is getting restless and they are also coming to the tail end of their DD and account opening - fingers crossed. 
Shall we work on them sending transactions through?
[28/3/25, 2:11:36 PM] Sandra Fortune: are we up for thur showing how to do it ? 
what do we need from them ? Or we use Ample's CSV format ?
[28/3/25, 2:15:29 PM] Sandra Fortune: @⁨Ben Menyala⁩  - i don't think we have shared format of CSV file ?
[28/3/25, 2:19:32 PM] HengHongLee: can just download the example csv from the site
‎[28/3/25, 2:20:17 PM] HengHongLee: example_bundle_csv.csv ‎document omitted
[28/3/25, 2:20:25 PM] HengHongLee: they use the same csv format
[28/3/25, 2:20:37 PM] HengHongLee: we do need a bunch of setup from their end
[28/3/25, 2:20:41 PM] HengHongLee: on the straitsx dashboard
[28/3/25, 2:21:27 PM] HengHongLee: this is the 
1. setup of webhooks (straitsx, pdax)
2. ⁠setup of authorized addresses
3. ⁠their api key access
[28/3/25, 2:23:38 PM] Sandra Fortune: awesome. So i send this over to them . 
Ishak the big boss asking me if thur can.
[28/3/25, 2:25:07 PM] Sandra Fortune: ok. this one they don't have yet. 
This Joshy boy - ask me for some doc -when actually Dazzling already sent through. I was looking through a whole bunch of stuff then realise it h
[28/3/25, 3:57:51 PM] Praise: Oh shit
[28/3/25, 3:58:05 PM] Praise: So even T + infinity fails
[28/3/25, 4:44:29 PM] Sandra Fortune: holy cow. if Dazzling come waltzing down with their $20K - it will be between huge refund or infinity fails !  🤪 ‎<This message was edited>
[28/3/25, 4:55:02 PM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[28/3/25, 5:02:41 PM] Praise: @⁨HengHongLee⁩ can please change the transaction type that was sent back to `reversal`
[28/3/25, 5:41:36 PM] HengHongLee: oh yeah forgot to do that
[28/3/25, 5:58:32 PM] Sandra Fortune: Guys - ample preempted me that they will send transactions on mondy as well
[31/3/25, 11:05:35 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hello guys. I’m seeing in increase of transactions but transaction page can’t see the transaction - is it my caching ?
[31/3/25, 11:12:51 AM] Ben Menyala: On yeahh I see the txns on bundle and metabase but I don’t see on txns table — I think there’s sth wrong with the txns table it’s not updated? @⁨HengHongLee⁩
[31/3/25, 11:13:57 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cool cool.
[31/3/25, 11:14:25 AM] HengHongLee: hmm
[31/3/25, 11:14:30 AM] Ben Menyala: Oh wait I see it
[31/3/25, 11:14:33 AM] HengHongLee: site went down for abit
[31/3/25, 11:14:35 AM] Ben Menyala: It’s just not sorted
‎[31/3/25, 11:15:19 AM] Ben Menyala: ‎image omitted
[31/3/25, 11:15:23 AM] Ben Menyala: the 30th one is here
[31/3/25, 11:15:41 AM] HengHongLee: i dont see any new ample transactions or bundles
[31/3/25, 11:16:32 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oooooohhh… cool. Saw it hahhaha
[31/3/25, 11:18:55 AM] Ben Menyala: On the 30th one haha that’s the new bundle
[31/3/25, 11:19:01 AM] Ben Menyala: About 2K plus
[31/3/25, 11:23:54 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah … QY told me at least 1k - means he send a lot more .. good good
[31/3/25, 11:25:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: And they send without us intervening - yay !
[31/3/25, 11:30:01 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahahah 7 more k to 110k

[31/3/25, 12:13:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Niceee
[31/3/25, 2:39:59 PM] Praise: I see why. There’s this transaction that happened 28th that’s fixed at the top so new transactions are coming under it
[31/3/25, 2:40:51 PM] Ben Menyala: ohh we should sort by transaction date instead of modified date i guess
[31/3/25, 2:42:35 PM] HengHongLee: yes the sorting is tricky
[31/3/25, 2:42:43 PM] HengHongLee: ill fix it later
[1/4/25, 8:27:28 AM] HengHongLee: heyy think today i wont go to office, need to wait at home for some deliveries

[1/4/25, 11:17:47 AM] Ben Menyala: I recall I send alr
[1/4/25, 11:17:57 AM] Ben Menyala: Last time he asked for it right
[1/4/25, 11:18:02 AM] Ben Menyala: Not recent chat right
[1/4/25, 11:18:06 AM] Ben Menyala: Let me find the email
[1/4/25, 11:18:47 AM] Sandra Fortune: think Milind just texted me last week - remember - you help to check the website
[1/4/25, 11:19:53 AM] Ben Menyala: Huhhh
[1/4/25, 11:20:02 AM] Ben Menyala: But I don’t see any website request
[1/4/25, 11:20:10 AM] Ben Menyala: He won’t ask for api docs right in the website
[1/4/25, 11:20:10 AM] Sandra Fortune: last week we were talking about checking the address on demo request on our website.
[1/4/25, 11:20:13 AM] Sandra Fortune: did you send then ?
[1/4/25, 11:20:19 AM] Ben Menyala: It’s just adding email only
[1/4/25, 11:20:27 AM] Ben Menyala: Doesn’t have any request
[1/4/25, 11:20:40 AM] Sandra Fortune: hahahha… i think he wrote an email to the demo request. 🤨 that's what milind say. 
But i didn't check
[1/4/25, 11:21:11 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha I checked through the email
[1/4/25, 11:21:16 AM] Ben Menyala: Don’t see it though
[1/4/25, 11:21:20 AM] Sandra Fortune: so Wenbing apparently requested for API docs through our website ? 
I don't know how he does that - cos website is really just to request for demo -that's all
[1/4/25, 11:21:34 AM] Sandra Fortune: think we can just send the API docs across.
[1/4/25, 11:21:56 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha there’s no way to do it
[1/4/25, 11:22:06 AM] Ben Menyala: Our website only takes emails
[1/4/25, 11:22:08 AM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha
[1/4/25, 11:23:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: yeah... now that i recall. its just input email and click - can't add any request in any email
[1/4/25, 11:23:43 AM] Sandra Fortune: not sure if Wen Bing is having issues with xweave.stoplight link
[1/4/25, 11:23:50 AM] Ben Menyala: Don’t think so
[1/4/25, 11:23:53 AM] Ben Menyala: We no need login
[1/4/25, 11:24:26 AM] HengHongLee: yeah its just a single page website

[9/4/25, 2:15:31 PM] Ben Menyala: Lololo let me check
‎[9/4/25, 2:15:42 PM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[9/4/25, 2:16:04 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohhh hmm
[9/4/25, 2:16:09 PM] Ben Menyala: Then it’s correct what
[9/4/25, 2:16:14 PM] Ben Menyala: Why the only 9 digits
[9/4/25, 2:16:20 PM] HengHongLee: 10-12
[9/4/25, 2:16:26 PM] Ben Menyala: Ya
[9/4/25, 2:16:28 PM] HengHongLee: so 9 + “00” is correct
[9/4/25, 2:16:30 PM] Ben Menyala: Why they never put
[9/4/25, 2:16:33 PM] HengHongLee: but they dont have the leading 00
[9/4/25, 2:16:34 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha
[9/4/25, 2:16:38 PM] Ben Menyala: I see
[9/4/25, 2:16:46 PM] Ben Menyala: Maybe their excel file removed the 00?
[9/4/25, 2:16:51 PM] HengHongLee: our system only taking 12 now
[9/4/25, 2:17:22 PM] HengHongLee: `’(?:BABDNPH|BABDOPH)-00\\d{8,10}|’`

seems like it should be like this
[9/4/25, 2:17:29 PM] Ben Menyala: Isn’t that only 11
[9/4/25, 2:17:43 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohhhh
[9/4/25, 2:17:46 PM] HengHongLee: yeah chatgpt say 10-12
[9/4/25, 2:17:53 PM] Ben Menyala: So ask them add 2 zeros in front?
[9/4/25, 2:18:09 PM] HengHongLee: `(?:BABDNPH|BABDOPH)-\\d{12}|` current setting
[9/4/25, 2:18:15 PM] HengHongLee: their 9 + 00 wont work
[9/4/25, 2:18:19 PM] HengHongLee: coz thats 11
[9/4/25, 2:18:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohhh ooops
[9/4/25, 2:18:28 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha
[9/4/25, 2:18:29 PM] HengHongLee: i make like this first?
[9/4/25, 2:18:39 PM] Ben Menyala: Can
[9/4/25, 2:18:42 PM] HengHongLee: ok
[9/4/25, 2:19:16 PM] HengHongLee: but we dont know if 00 + 10 digits works with pdax
[9/4/25, 2:19:28 PM] HengHongLee: they only said 12 nothing about the 00
[9/4/25, 2:23:17 PM] HengHongLee: anyway re:Grab our apis are outdated slightly. need to update ‎<This message was edited>

[14/4/25, 2:32:52 PM] Praise: AC03: This is commonly an error or return code in financial transactions. In SWIFT messaging or ISO 20022, AC03 usually refers to an invalid creditor account number—basically, the beneficiary’s account details are incorrect or not recognized.
[14/4/25, 2:35:24 PM] HengHongLee: maybe another 0 missing haha
[14/4/25, 2:36:11 PM] Sandra Fortune: till today.. .i still don't know how many zeros is needed … kekekke

[14/4/25, 2:43:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha yeahh
[14/4/25, 2:43:54 PM] HengHongLee: seems like IR only supports withdrawal of USDC from solana and eth
[14/4/25, 2:44:00 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh
[14/4/25, 2:44:18 PM] Ben Menyala: Oh but I think pdax got sol

[14/4/25, 2:45:45 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha oh is it
[14/4/25, 2:46:00 PM] Ben Menyala: So it’s milind and Laura vs TW and Josh?
[14/4/25, 2:46:01 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahahha

[14/4/25, 2:47:15 PM] Ben Menyala: Hopefully Josh doesn’t end up as serious casualty
[14/4/25, 2:47:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: Josh told me that it’s Monday - that was Friday afternoon when we spoke

Milind said he wanted me to provide Laura background today at 2.30 but doesn’t seem like it’s happening
[14/4/25, 2:47:41 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha
[14/4/25, 2:48:07 PM] Sandra Fortune: He should be padding himself with armour for today.

[14/4/25, 2:49:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahha
[14/4/25, 2:49:10 PM] Sandra Fortune: We escalate yes. But TW is to solve that problem 
We are not in the mode of “fucking people up” because we are angry 
😬
[14/4/25, 2:49:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Milind still want Laura to tell TW Temasek as an xweave investor will not want Xweave to use straitsX

[14/4/25, 2:49:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah - I don’t think so too.
She’s smart - so I am sure she will do it in her usual friend way

[16/4/25, 3:44:51 PM] Praise: Noice
[16/4/25, 3:55:21 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Praise⁩ i suspect we need to throttle these pdax calls
[16/4/25, 3:55:32 PM] Praise: The execution right?
[16/4/25, 3:55:37 PM] Praise: Seems can’t handle them
[16/4/25, 3:55:38 PM] HengHongLee: out of the 7. one failed and succeeded when i retried
[16/4/25, 3:55:50 PM] HengHongLee: yeah 🤦
[16/4/25, 3:56:23 PM] Praise: Ok. Can update the meta workflow that when it’s parallel don’t actually do it all at same time?
[16/4/25, 3:56:49 PM] Praise: I can put a max of 5 execution in parallel instead
[16/4/25, 3:56:50 PM] HengHongLee: maybe split into sets of 5 and do them in series
[16/4/25, 3:56:53 PM] HengHongLee: yeah
[16/4/25, 3:56:56 PM] Praise: Haha. Same mind
[16/4/25, 3:56:59 PM] Praise: 😂
[16/4/25, 3:57:00 PM] HengHongLee: hahah yeah
[16/4/25, 3:58:13 PM] HengHongLee: must put a huge note there saying we are intentionally delaying this coz pdax cant handle all our txn
[16/4/25, 3:59:13 PM] Praise: Haha. Or maybe we don’t need to actually wait for the first set to complete. Just that we won’t send all at same time?
[16/4/25, 4:00:19 PM] Praise: We can’t actually wait because the quotes
[16/4/25, 4:00:41 PM] Praise: We just time it that should process 5 every 3-5 mins or so
[16/4/25, 4:00:56 PM] Praise: Ah that exponentially increases
[16/4/25, 4:01:03 PM] Praise: If we have 50 items
[16/4/25, 4:01:05 PM] HengHongLee: yeah just put a delayer of 10sec or smth
[16/4/25, 4:01:15 PM] HengHongLee: btw each set of 5
[16/4/25, 4:01:22 PM] Praise: Exactly
[16/4/25, 4:04:01 PM] HengHongLee: maybe its not pdax. maybe its instapay
[16/4/25, 4:04:16 PM] HengHongLee: or someone downstream

[1/5/25, 9:15:23 AM] HengHongLee: you should go back to visa and join this bridge thingy
[1/5/25, 9:15:51 AM] HengHongLee: everyone is trying to do cards tho
[1/5/25, 9:16:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: AP solutions there still haven’t caught on but some leads in APAC wants to do this 
Maybe can consider joining them - who knows 🤔🤔
[1/5/25, 9:16:53 AM] Sandra Fortune: Cos cards currently relatively untouched - only some efforts to do so - not making much of a dent 
Everyone trying to get the big chunk off
[1/5/25, 9:18:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: There’s a lot more room for the schemes to leverage on stables - but not done yet . But maybe in a year or so they will
[1/5/25, 9:18:25 AM] Ben Menyala: I saw this coming hahahaha
[1/5/25, 9:18:33 AM] Ben Menyala: After Mastercard did their press releases two days ago
[1/5/25, 9:18:41 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahah … ya.
[1/5/25, 9:18:43 AM] Ben Menyala: But ya they selling shovels now
[1/5/25, 9:18:46 AM] Ben Menyala: Very good
[1/5/25, 9:19:03 AM] Ben Menyala: It’ll be good to join their team hahahahha
[1/5/25, 9:19:08 AM] HengHongLee: ya exactly this
[1/5/25, 9:19:26 AM] Sandra Fortune: Was talking to visa on tue on their likely hood to go stables on their money move 
Slow and need expertise 🙂
[1/5/25, 9:19:27 AM] HengHongLee: just integrate stablecoins as settlement for using Visa main product
[1/5/25, 9:19:44 AM] HengHongLee: which is 3% charge on all payments
[1/5/25, 9:20:17 AM] Sandra Fortune: They should … but currently global head of product … move slow 
If it starts from apac - will be faster
[1/5/25, 9:20:58 AM] Sandra Fortune: Current head of blockchain super nice guy - so probably didn’t bull doze … need assholes to bull doze 🤣🤣
[1/5/25, 9:21:26 AM] Sandra Fortune: But jokes aside - there are ppl in visa who are going in that direction
[1/5/25, 9:25:05 AM] HengHongLee: i’d love to see visa/mastercard lose business but for now i dont think anyone is coming up with a good alternative
[1/5/25, 9:25:17 AM] HengHongLee: i should buy some Visa / mastercard stocks
‎[1/5/25, 9:25:27 AM] HengHongLee: ‎image omitted
[1/5/25, 9:28:00 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yes. Actually when price is lower 
They really make good money
I haven’t checked how much it is at now
[1/5/25, 9:28:05 AM] Sandra Fortune: Oooh nice
[1/5/25, 9:28:33 AM] Sandra Fortune: Wow - got $1k
[1/5/25, 9:29:01 AM] Sandra Fortune: Closes is the Chinese on wallet
But not internationalised unfortunately
[1/5/25, 9:29:41 AM] HengHongLee: 2.5k sgd
[1/5/25, 9:29:43 AM] Sandra Fortune: The way visa position themselves is like how banks position themselves in money moves 
At the end of the day - they will always be the anchor that can’t be changed
[1/5/25, 9:30:37 AM] Sandra Fortune: In total …
Nice …
🤣🤣🤣
[1/5/25, 9:30:49 AM] Sandra Fortune: And we’ve hit way above $200k usd
[1/5/25, 9:33:28 AM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ https://youtu.be/dFK_u8pDV3Q
[1/5/25, 9:35:34 AM] HengHongLee: free money everyday these guys
[1/5/25, 9:38:24 AM] Sandra Fortune: Hahahah 
The debt on credit don’t go to the schemes - it’s to the banks Kekek
[1/5/25, 9:38:48 AM] Sandra Fortune: But it is very true - it’s monopolistic
[1/5/25, 9:39:08 AM] Sandra Fortune: That’s why the Plaid deal didn’t go thru
[1/5/25, 9:40:28 AM] Sandra Fortune: Bill Sheedy ! The visa guy - such an institution. His still there! Haha
[1/5/25, 9:45:25 AM] Sandra Fortune: A huge misconception. 
Visa don’t earn interchange although we set it. Visa charge separate fees (network fees.. etc) per txn - it’s tiered base on flat fee and/or bps - depends 
Card issuers are the one who earns it
[1/5/25, 10:03:49 AM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah saw this it’s the weirdest thing because Stripe has its own issuing platform
[1/5/25, 10:05:18 AM] Sandra Fortune: Interesting comment on the article on visa and bridge 

Stripe offers an issuing platform but don’t issue cards . (Just saying)
And it processes typical card flows but not stables 
Hence they have to work with bridge mah

[13/5/25, 7:38:25 PM] Praise: Yes that’s the next

[13/5/25, 7:38:57 PM] Sandra Fortune: I don’t know since milind hasn’t been running the business at all - not sure how it will look like
[13/5/25, 7:40:13 PM] Praise: A lot to consider. But yea the offer is actually juicy. But it comes with lots of risk
[13/5/25, 7:40:42 PM] Ben Menyala: Ohh you got the number from milind already?
[13/5/25, 7:40:44 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha

[17/6/25, 12:53:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: Nay. No 2nd chance.
If product is so adamant on things her way - then capturing APAC market will be tough. In fact - will be very unsuccessful 
It’s base on a business decision that I am not interested.
[17/6/25, 12:54:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: Until they re-think their strategy - else - it wouldn’t fly

[7/7/25, 11:21:36 AM] HengHongLee: never have i handed over something so complete
[7/7/25, 11:24:51 AM] Sandra Fortune: It was the Stx case. Milind wanted me to talk to Laura to push TW to do Lulu’s KYB in expedited timeline .
Because he is partying - he ask me to ask Laura 

Laura called me and told me that TW has been clear that doing sg-Phil is a cost and hence not going to support expedited.
When she told me that - I told her - that’s an impt piece of news that I am hearing for the first time
[7/7/25, 11:25:36 AM] Sandra Fortune: She was shocked as well

I added that I am reaching out per M’s instructions

She was even more piss off when she heard that
[7/7/25, 11:26:24 AM] Sandra Fortune: Its asking her to put her friendship with TW in jeopardy by pushing for Xweave 

I apologies on M’s behalf and ask her to connect me to TW and I’ll sort out the rest
[7/7/25, 11:26:37 AM] Sandra Fortune: So that’s the probably another weight to the scale
[7/7/25, 11:27:49 AM] Ben Menyala: Milind hahaha

[7/7/25, 6:12:44 PM] Ben Menyala: But for now there’s no api cos most people need to negotiate rates
[7/7/25, 6:12:52 PM] Ben Menyala: Like they can say give more collateral
[7/7/25, 6:12:55 PM] Ben Menyala: To get lower rates
[7/7/25, 6:13:25 PM] Ben Menyala: Yo Ben btw just a brief summary could u let me know which kind of commods firms are these who need short term loans
[7/7/25, 6:13:26 PM] Ben Menyala: And what usually can they give as collat

[15/7/25, 9:19:56 PM] HengHongLee: @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩ ph-sg dont have bps adjustment ‎<This message was edited>
[15/7/25, 9:21:06 PM] HengHongLee: and i think 0.025 number is rounded
[15/7/25, 9:21:07 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha why Heng hong working for free
[15/7/25, 9:21:24 PM] HengHongLee: so its not accurate. the rate diff % is correct
[15/7/25, 9:21:27 PM] HengHongLee: hahahaha
[15/7/25, 9:21:15 PM] Ben Menyala: Should charge milind consultant fee
[15/7/25, 9:25:05 PM] Sandra Fortune: Oh. That does not explain the difference in quote. 
Agus says and insist that it’s because its base on 9 decimal places while what is displayed is 4 
I did the math and it’s correct leh …
[15/7/25, 9:25:45 PM] Sandra Fortune: So it’s caused by a real rate change ?
[15/7/25, 9:25:50 PM] Sandra Fortune: Wait - I don’t understand
[15/7/25, 9:26:21 PM] HengHongLee: this is correct i believe
[15/7/25, 9:26:41 PM] HengHongLee: i mean the rate diff % under the 0.025 number
[15/7/25, 9:26:43 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yes yes. Then it’s correct
[15/7/25, 9:26:57 PM] HengHongLee: that one is calculated from the difference of market vs quote
[15/7/25, 9:27:04 PM] HengHongLee: that one is accurate
[15/7/25, 9:27:19 PM] Sandra Fortune: Ok. Got it. So we are in the right zone
[15/7/25, 9:27:48 PM] HengHongLee: yeah just that 0.025 number got more digits behind
[15/7/25, 9:27:59 PM] HengHongLee: or rounded
[15/7/25, 9:28:11 PM] HengHongLee: so 0.024899 also can be 0.025
[15/7/25, 9:28:29 PM] HengHongLee: should fix to show everything
[15/7/25, 9:28:32 PM] Sandra Fortune: Yeah … and when it’s a large number it becomes crazy
[15/7/25, 9:29:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: I was asking Agus - should we show everything ? Or decide to deal with 4 or 5 decimal places and display as such
[15/7/25, 9:29:25 PM] HengHongLee: yeah can let him decide
[15/7/25, 9:31:01 PM] Sandra Fortune: Kekekekeke … yeah 
But he not comitting yet
[15/7/25, 9:31:26 PM] Sandra Fortune: today damn soul zapping as it seems that Andrew and Swastik is not getting along 
And Agus is also not getting along with Swastik

[15/7/25, 9:35:53 PM] Ben Menyala: Wahhh what did Swastik get from milind
[15/7/25, 9:35:59 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahaha and what you give to Ina
[15/7/25, 9:36:03 PM] Ben Menyala: Ina doesn’t touch code right
[15/7/25, 9:37:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: About him asking baseline questions
Actually I quite frustrated with Swastik also. Say he coming to office and don’t appear - like what the heck 

Don’t know still don’t attend class.

[15/7/25, 9:38:18 PM] Sandra Fortune: Hehhehe . She was pulling out something and sharing on the group chat
Then I ask her - isnt that sg to ph leg ; we are looking at reverse flow
😬
Then she apologise and say she send wrongly
I felt so bad at that point

[15/7/25, 9:39:58 PM] Ben Menyala: Hahahaha
[15/7/25, 9:40:16 PM] Ben Menyala: Think he isn’t planning to stay in xweave for long anyway
[15/7/25, 9:40:55 PM] HengHongLee: where can he go?
[15/7/25, 9:41:01 PM] Ben Menyala: But I think he didn’t realise if he doesn’t pass the subject he might be asked to leave before he executes his plans
[15/7/25, 9:41:29 PM] Ben Menyala: Probably another crypto or stablecoin company
[15/7/25, 9:42:03 PM] Sandra Fortune: I wouldn’t be surprise
[15/7/25, 9:42:48 PM] Sandra Fortune: This dude - not serious la. 
I really feel like I’m dealing with my 10 year old
Even my teenager is more responsible!
[15/7/25, 9:43:54 PM] Sandra Fortune: I told milind to have all Eng report to him - but he doesn’t want
He wants cait and Andrew to report to Swastik
[15/7/25, 9:44:38 PM] Sandra Fortune: But boss also say - if his rude to Andrew he will need to speak to Swastik
[15/7/25, 9:46:36 PM] HengHongLee: lolol
[15/7/25, 9:49:01 PM] Ben Menyala: 🤣🤣🤣
[15/7/25, 9:49:24 PM] Ben Menyala: I think Andrew is more senior than Swastik?
[15/7/25, 9:50:33 PM] HengHongLee: i think @⁨Sandra Fortune⁩’s teenager is more senior than Swastik
[15/7/25, 9:50:39 PM] HengHongLee: 🤣🤣

[23/7/25, 4:24:04 PM] Sandra Fortune: he told Swastik at the get go that his Lead Eng.

[5/8/25, 1:43:31 PM] Sandra Fortune: Interesting- so it becomes usable to a larger audience
[5/8/25, 1:43:39 PM] HengHongLee: just a fun project for dca btc
