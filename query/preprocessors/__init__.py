"""
Query Preprocessors Package

This package contains modular preprocessing strategies for user queries.
Each preprocessor handles a specific aspect of query preprocessing:

- TextCleaner: Cleans and normalizes text
- EntityExtractor: Extracts entities from queries
- IntentClassifier: Classifies user intent
- KeywordExtractor: Extracts important keywords
- PreprocessorPipeline: Combines all preprocessing strategies

The modular design allows for easy extension and customization of preprocessing logic.
